The actuation for the device is realized by {SMA} wires, in order to reduce bulk and weight, and the displacements are measured by optical sensors. The performance of the device has been verified experimentally.},

	abstract = {Human-machine collaborative teleoperation systems were introduced to overcome limitations of state-of-the-art teleoperation systems by using a virtual assistant that supports the human operator in the execution of a task. Since assistances are highly task-dependent a correct classification of the currently performed task is paramount. In this paper, we present a novel approach for improving task classification for a human-machine collaborative teleoperation system. Starting from a classical {HMM-based} classifier implemented in our previous research, we introduce a method for correcting erroneous task classifications by evaluating an agreement criterion. This criterion is based on interactive forces and is used to distinguish between situations in which human and assistant agree/disagree in their execution of the task. Using disagreement as indicator for the activation of an unsuitable/suboptimal assistance, erroneous task classifications are identified and the original classification result is revised. The proposed approach shows significant improvements in task classification coming along with a comparable low implementation effort.},

This paper presents the design and control of a modular 3-finger haptic device that can be used to interact with virtual scenarios or to teleoperate dexterous remote hands. In a modular haptic device, each module allows the interaction with a scenario by using a single finger; hence, multi-finger interaction can be achieved by adding more modules. Control requirements for a multifinger haptic device are analyzed and new hardware/software architecture for these kinds of devices is proposed. The software architecture described in this paper is distributed and the different modules communicate to allow the remote manipulation. Moreover, an application in which this haptic device is used to interact with a virtual scenario is shown.},

Hand movements were classified according to two criteria into three movement types. Results indicated that an easy search was performed with a parallel strategy, while in a more difficult search a serial movement strategy is used. Short, fluent movements were made in the easy search, whereas the difficult search showed more detailed movements and this amount increased when more items were to be searched. These differences between the search tasks remained when corrected for travelled distance, while path length could partly explain dissimilarities between trials with a target present and absent. Overall, these results indicate that movement strategies are adjusted primarily to the search condition and the salience of the target, and less to the presence of a target and set size.},

Though a listener may perceive a movement from the first tone to the second, each tone merely begins and ends at its stationary position on the frequency continuum. Recent advances in the modeling of apparent- motion effects in vision provide a starting point for the modeling of the strong apparent- motion effects in music. An adaptation of the Grossberg- Rudd model of apparent motion in vision, when given input representing the strengths of pitch sensations positioned along a one- dimensional frequency continuum, can simulate important musical phenomena of auditory stream segregation, van Noorden's melodic- fission/ temporal- coherence boundaries, various Gestalt effects, aspects of dynamic attending, and Narmour's predicted categorical distinction between musical intervals implying a continuation and those implying a reversal of direction.},

The aim of the project was to develop an “invisible” technological setup that would allow the performer to move freely on stage while still being in full control of the electronics. The developed system consists of a video-based motion-tracking system, with a camera hanging in the ceiling above the stage. The performer's motion and position on stage is used to control the playback of sonic fragments from a database of violin sounds, using concatenative synthesis as the sound engine. The setup allows the performer to improvise freely together with the electronic sounds being played back as she moves around the “sonic space.” The system has been stable in rehearsal and performance, and the simplicity of the approach has been inspiring to both the performer and the audience.},

	abstract = {Haptic augmented reality merges real and virtual feedback, allowing a user to touch the real environment augmented with virtual haptic stimuli. A key functionality of this technology is altering the haptic properties of real objects by means of virtual haptic feedback. Previously, we have developed a haptic augmentation system in which object stiffness was modulated. In this paper, we extend our framework to cover further haptic properties: friction and weight. Simple but effective algorithms for estimating and altering these properties have been developed. The first approach allows us to change the inherent friction between a tool tip and a surface to a desired one identified in an offline process. The second technique enables a user to perceive an altered weight when lifting an object at two interaction points. The performance of the proposed algorithms has been evaluated on real objects. The errors remain within reasonable bounds and compare well to the relevant perceptual Weber fractions. Limitations of our technique are identified, and possible extensions are proposed.},

	abstract = {Audiovisual communications is at the core of multimedia systems that allow users to interact across distances. It is common understanding that both audio and video are required for high-quality interaction. While audiovisual information provides a user with a satisfactory impression of being present in a remote environment, physical interaction and manipulation is not supported. True immersion into a distant environment and efficient distributed collaboration require the ability to physically interact with remote objects and to literally get in touch with other people. Touching and manipulating objects remotely becomes possible if we augment traditional audiovisual communications by the haptic modality. Haptic communications is a relatively young field of research that has the potential to substantially improve human-human and human-machine interaction. In this paper, we discuss the state-of-the-art in haptic communications both from psychophysical and technical points of view. From a human perception point of view, we mainly focus on the multimodal integration of video and haptics and the improved performance that can be achieved when combining them. We also discuss how the human adapts to discrepancies and synchronization errors between different modalities, a research area which is typically referred to as perceptual learning. From a technical perspective, we address perceptual coding of haptic information and the transmission of haptic data streams over resource-constrained and potentially lossy networks in the presence of unpredictable and time-varying communication delays. In this context, we also discuss the need for objective quality metrics for haptic communication. Throughout the paper, we stress the fact that haptic communications is not meant as a replacement of traditional audiovisual communications but rather as an additional dimension for telepresence that will allow us to advance in our quest for truly immersive communication.},

	abstract = {In telepresence and teleaction systems the haptic communication channel plays a central role. As it closes a global control loop any introduced communication delay possibly destabilizes the system and impairs the performance. The scattering theory is known to solve these stability issues by transmitting wave variables instead of haptic signals, i.e. force and velocity, over the communication channel. For stability and performance additionally high packet rates are required stressing the underlying network resources. Perceptual coding techniques of haptic signals, such as the Weber-inspired deadband approach, are known to successfully reduce the packet rate on the haptic channel. However, as wave variables do not directly represent haptic information but a linear transformation of both signals, perceptual coding is not directly applicable anymore. In this paper, we present a novel control scheme as well as a modification of the deadband approach to take advantage of the stabilization ability of the wave variables while allowing perceptual coding on the communication channel. Simulation results and comparison with the wave variables architecture indicate improved data compression for same degree of transparency for purely stiff as well as free environments.},

	abstract = {Abstract For many people, live concerts occupy an important position in their experience of music. The interaction between audience and performers creates a special tension, which also influences the performing musicians. This paper presents a method to study how the presence of an audience influences performers. To study this influence, a concert with a singer and a viola da gamba player was recorded using audio, video and acceleration sensors (invisibly) attached to wrists and back of the performers. These data were compared to the general rehearsal, recorded in identical settings. This enabled a scientifically valid comparison, without challenging ecological validity. General rehearsal and concert performances were relatively similar, which shows that performers are able to reproduce their interpretation. However, comparison between conditions revealed some interesting differences. Tempo analysis showed that the pieces in a slower, more flexible tempo were performed slower in concert, while the faster, more dance-like tempi were performed slightly faster. Gesture analysis suggested a tendency for the singer to use more open, communicative postures during the concert, to change posture more often and take more time in the transitions. The movement analysis showed an overall increase in intensity of the hand movements of the singer. In summary, we may conclude that the different methods of analysis demonstrated an intensification of the performance while interacting with the audience.},

Through iterative design, prototyping, programming, and testing, each of these servo-motor-based mechanisms produces a signal that is gradable in magnitude, can be played in a variety of temporal patterns, is localizable to a small area of skin, and, for three of the four actuators, has an associated direction. Additionally, we have tried to design toward many of the characteristics that have made high frequency vibration the most common form of wearable tactile feedback, including low cost, light weight, comfort, and small size. Bolstered by largely positive comments from naive users during an informal testing session, we plan to continue improving these devices for future use in tactile motion guidance.},

In vision, spatial constancy refers to the conversion of retinotopic signals into spatiotopic representations, allowing the observer to perceive space independently of his or her own eye movements, or at least partly so. The problem would seem at least as important in haptic perception, where sensory surfaces undergo even more complex movements in space. Here we develop a methodology for studying haptic spatial constancy, which involves a tactile display mounted on a mobile platform, and which allows us to decouple movements of the sensory surface - in this case the fingertip - from movements of objects on the fingertip. Using this apparatus, we find evidence for only weak haptic spatial constancy.},

	abstract = {Enclosing objects in the hand is a common and efficient way of haptic exploration. Recently, the importance of grasping for more realistic haptic perception of virtual objects has been recognised in haptic interface design. While several studies on haptic perception have addressed haptic exploration of a single object, perception of several objects grasped together in the hand has received almost no attention yet. In this study we focus on the importance of freedom to manipulate the objects in the hand for three-dimensional shape perception. Furthermore, we investigate differences in detection speed for different positions in the grasping hand. Subjects were asked to search for a cube among spheres or for a sphere among cubes. Response times were measured for different locations of target shape in the hand. Also, the way in which the items were fixed was varied from allowing small displacements and rotation of the shapes to rigidly fixed. There were only differences in search times between the different positions in the hand, when the centre item was difficult to access because of the surrounding items. Finally, we show that search was faster when the items were rigidly fixed than when displacement and rotation was possible. This shows that more exploratory freedom does not necessarily make search for a three-dimensional shape faster.},

We analyse the requirements of such a musical social game, as well as the possible application fields, such as musicology research, team-building and health care.

The system can render different switches arranged on a virtual control panel by a single haptic device. A motion planning algorithm for the encountered-type haptic device is proposed so that the device is properly encountered by the user at the switch locations while it avoids unintended collisions with the user elsewhere. To reduce the duty of the device motion, the weighting function in the algorithm is improved. Control panel surface coordinates are newly introduced in the motion planning so that unintended collisions of the device with the user are completely avoided in free space. The proposed motion planning algorithm with some improvements is verified by numerical simulations.},

The haptic interface, which consists of a robot arm and hand, can be used in a large workspace and can provide multipoint contact between the user and a virtual environment. However, the following problems peculiar to a multi-{DOF} robot have resulted: a backlash, a large amount of friction, many motors, and many sensors. In order to solve these problems, a new mechanism and a wire-saving control system have been designed and developed. Furthermore, experiments in both free space and constraint space have been carried out. In comparison with the previous {HIRO}, the force errors in free space and in constraint space have been reduced to 30\% and 57\%, respectively. These results show a high-precision force representation and the great potential of {HIRO} {III.}},

Our tactile enhancement device mimics the structure of hair follicle receptors. A matrix structure simulating artificial body hair is driven by minute forces external to the skin surface. This structure can be used on any surface of the human body because it is fully composed of passive elements.},

	abstract = {We have developed two different magnetic levitation devices which provide unprecedented ranges of motion in both translation and rotation to a levitated handle to be used for tool-based haptic interaction. The first device levitates a handle attached to a thin spherical shell of flat coils suspended in permanent magnet fields using Lorentz forces. A novel coil type and magnet configuration provides motion ranges of 50 mm and 60 degrees in all directions, double the translation and triple the rotation ranges of the current maximum range Lorentz levitation haptic devices developed at Carnegie Mellon University. The second device uses a planar array of cylindrical coils to levitate a platform of one or more magnets. By using redundant control methods and an experimentally measured high resolution model of the forces and torques generated on the levitated magnets from each coil, the translation range of the magnet in horizontal directions and its rotation in all directions and can be extended potentially indefinitely. The present prototype uses 10 coils to levitate a single magnet over a 80times60 mm planar range, a 30 mm vertical range, and a tilt range of 40 degrees, or to control the yaw rotation of a pair of magnets over 360 degrees. Design and control methods are presented with preliminary motion trajectory results from both devices.},

At the first level, motion features are compared in the spatial context of the current video frame; at the intermediate level, salient behavior is analyzed on a short temporal context; at the third level, computation of saliency is extended to longer time windows. An attention/saliency index is computed at the three levels based on an information theory approach. This model can be considered as a preliminary step towards context-aware expressive gesture analysis.},

In this study, we investigate the influence of edges on perception of the shape of {3D} objects. We tested two conditions in which subjects were asked to indicate the orientation of a block by exploring it either statically without touching the edges or freely. When edges were excluded, the threshold to determine the orientation of a block was an aspect ratio of 1.030. When the edges were explored, the threshold was 1.045. We conclude that edges disrupt the precision at which {3D} objects can be perceived.},

However, almost every commercial software framework for gesture and pose detection is aimed at either desktop {PCs} or high-powered {GPUs}, making mobile implementations for gesture recognition an attractive area for research and development. In this paper we present an algorithm for hand skeleton tracking and gesture recognition that runs on an {ARM-based} platform (Pandaboard {ES}, {OMAP} 4460 architecture). The algorithm uses self-organizing maps to fit a given topology (skeleton) into a {3D} point cloud. This is a novel way of approaching the problem of pose recognition as it does not employ complex optimization techniques or data-based learning. After an initial background segmentation step, the algorithm is ran in parallel with heuristics, which detect and correct artifacts arising from insufficient or erroneous input data. We then optimize the algorithm for the {ARM} platform using fixed-point computation and the {NEON} {SIMD} architecture the {OMAP4460} provides. We tested the algorithm with two different depth-sensing devices (Microsoft Kinect, {PMD} Camboard). For both input devices we were able to accurately track the skeleton at the native framerate of the cameras.},

To counter these issues, efficient perceptually motivated packet-rate reduction schemes have been developed. These schemes are conventionally evaluated for perceived quality via subjective user tests. Such tests are time-consuming, expensive and require precise control of experimental conditions. Computer modeling of telepresence sessions can, on the other hand, bring repeatability, ease of observation, definite control over system parameters and task description and fairness of comparison. In this paper, we present first steps towards a methodology and a framework to model and simulate a networked haptic interaction and evaluate it objectively for the quality of experience. Towards this purpose, we model the human control action and haptic perception process in teleoperation. Our results show that simulations of these models for a range of data reduction scheme parameters produce quality estimates whose trend is comparable to carefully performed subjective user tests.},

A follow-up experiment with the contact-location alone condition resulted in higher (worse) edge sharpness discrimination thresholds, especially at higher edge radius values.

Using kinematic displays of four clarinetists, perceptual experiments were conducted in which participants were asked to rate specific music-related dimensions of the performance and the performer. Additionally, motions of particular body parts, such as movements of the arms and torso, as well as motion amplitudes of the whole body were manipulated in the kinematic display. It was found that manipulations of arm and torso movements have fewer effects on the observers' ratings of the musicians than manipulations concerning the movement of the whole body. The results suggest that the multimodal experience of musicians is less dependent on the players' particular body motion behaviors than it is on the players' overall relative motion characteristics.},

The sensation level difference due to the different frequencies that result when using vibrating motors on the right and left fingers causes a phantom sensation that is perceived as if the stimuli were between the fingers. The change of sensation level difference between both hands due to the frequency modulation creates a somatosensory illusion using this phantom sensation, which occurs in such a way as to feel like a vibration flow from one hand to the other hand. We conducted experiments to evaluate whether the tactile flow and the phantom sensation can be perceived. Participants reported sensing the vibrotactile flow and the phantom sensation.},

More must be understood about the skills involved in palpation. The present study compares the ability of practicing veterinarians and veterinary students to identify stiffness values. An absolute identification paradigm was used where a force-feedback device rendered virtual surfaces with 5 levels of stiffness within a ldquoclinically relevantrdquo range of 0.2 - 0.5 N/mm. The results from 12 veterinarians and 14 veterinary students show that the veterinarians performed significantly better than the students (p Lt 0.001). The mean information transfer was 0.97 bits (almost 2 perfectly-identifiable stiffness levels) for the veterinarians and 0.58 bits (1 correctly-identified stiffness level) for the students. However, neither group was able to reliably identify more than 2 levels of stiffness, indicating that the success of veterinarians in clinical practice probably relies on additional properties such as size, shape and texture. Our findings suggest that stiffness perception in the context of veterinary medicine is a learned clinical skill. Quantifying expert ability will help inform teaching methods and set targets for students. Similar psychophysical methods can also be used to monitor student performance throughout the learning process. Future work will examine the contributions of other object properties as well as motor strategies to palpation performance.},

Many mechanical conflicts arise when trying to put to work together two or more conventional haptic devices. Due to collisions and other incompatibilities the resulting workspace when using these configurations is usually too small, making this a non-viable option. Therefore, a new multi-finger haptic device called {MasterFinger} 3 is developed to meet the demands of freedom of movement within a wide workspace. The aim of the new haptic device presented in this paper is to allow an intuitive human-machine interaction in a natural fashion. This interaction permits the end-user to control and operate an advanced robotic hand precisely. In order to reach this purpose, the attitude of at least three fingers should be measured. Moreover, the attitude of the other two fingers can be deduced from those measurements. Consequently, the mechanical design and the electronic architecture are described in detail in the following sections.},

	abstract = {Haptic cues take on meaning as a function of the context in which they are experienced. In interaction with objects in the physical environment, the context always includes a mechanical contact, at which point force and motion variables can be identified, and across which power may flow. In interaction with objects in a virtual or remote environment, it is not necessary for the contact across which haptic responses are rendered to be the same as the contact at which exploratory actions are applied. In this paper, we ask whether force/motion coupling has a significant impact on manual performance or cognitive load. We conducted an experiment in which n=7 participants attempted, while acting through a teleoperator, to discriminate three objects by their stiffness under two conditions. In one condition physical force/motion coupling was present, in the other it was not. To assess cognitive load, we engaged participants in a simultaneous cognitive task that included a response time measure. Results indicated no difference in manual discrimination performance. After rejecting the datasets of three of our participants based on inconsistent strategy by condition, we observed a small, non-significant trend toward lower cognitive load in the condition with physical coupling. Establishing a robust trend will require additional participants. While results are preliminary, we offer our paradigm as an important direction for new inquiry into the distinctions and interrelationships between information and its presentation in various haptic interface applications. Our work is aimed in particular at developing haptic feedback for use in prosthetic applications.},

	abstract = {Abstract In computational approaches to the study of variation among folk song melodies from oral culture, both global and local features of melodies have been used. From a computational point of view, the representation of a melody as a vector of global feature values, each summarizing an aspect of the entire melody, is attractive. However, from an annotation study on perceived melodic similarity and human categorization in music it followed that local features of melodies are most important to classify and recognize melodies. We compare both approaches in a computational classification task. In both cases, the discriminative power of features is assessed. We use a feature evaluation criterion that is based on the performance of a nearest-neighbour classifier. As distance measure for vectors of global features, we use the Euclidian distance. For the sequences of local features, we use the score of the {Needleman–Wunsch} alignment algorithm. In each of our comparisons, the local features correspond to the global features. In all cases, it appears that the local approach outperforms the global approach in a classification task for melodies, which indicates that local features carry more information about the identity of melodies. Therefore, locality is a crucial factor in modelling melodic similarity among folk song melodies.},

The assistance level determines the amount of support provided by the assistant. It should be adapted autonomously such that task performance and human effort are optimized. The effect of the assistance level on task performance and human effort may, however, be different depending on whether human and assistant agree on the actions or not. In this paper, we investigate the effect of the assistance level on task performance and effort for a scenario, in which human and assistant agree and for a scenario, where they disagree. We present a force-based criterion for distinguishing between the two scenarios and introduce an approach to optimize the assistance levels for each of the scenarios. Finally we sketch, how the results can be used to develop novel assistance adaptation schemes.},

The present study examined haptic contributions in object handover. On each trial one participant held an object and passed it to the other participant at self-selected, fixed or randomly varied positions. In some trials, the receiver wore a glove to attenuate tactile information. The results showed that the passer’s time of grip release relative to contact was later when the transfer location randomly varied or when the receiver wore the glove. On the other hand, forces at contact dropped across trials with negligible effects of glove or transfer location. In conclusion, the present study demonstrated that the dyad reduced redundant forces at contact by forming a stereotypical handover movement in a feedforward manner, while the sensory feedback modulates timing of object handover to avoid premature release of grip by the passer.},

In particular, a feedback stabilized closest point tracking algorithm is utilized for real-time determination of the contour error and online construction of the velocity field. The algorithm augments the system dynamics with a new state, and implements a uniformly asymptotically stable controller to update this new state to continual track the closest point to the robot end-effector. Thanks to its feedback-stabilized core, the algorithm is immune to initialization errors, and robust against drift and numerical noise. Furthermore, requiring simple evaluations of the curve and its unit tangents, the approach is computationally efficient. Applicability and effectiveness of the approach to implement passive contour following tasks have been demonstrated through simulations and experiments with a two degrees-of-freedom haptic interface.},

	abstract = {A novel thin film polydimethylsiloxane ({PDMS)} based flexible tactile micro sensor has been developed for contact traction distribution measurement between an indenter and an object (e.g. finger pad). The tactile sensor is a five layer device consisting of 2 layers of textured patterns sandwiched between 3 layers of {PDMS.} The textured patterns are protected by a thin layer of {PDMS} (25 microns) on each side and are separated by a thicker {PDMS} layer (100 microns). The sensor thus has a total thickness of 150 microns, much less than the thickness of the human fingertip skin. The entire device is fabricated bottom up on a silicon wafer using soft lithography and microfabrication techniques. The sensor is designed to be used with an imaging apparatus (in our case we use an Optical Coherence Tomography ({OCT)} apparatus). The deflection of the patterns due to an applied load is imaged by the {OCT} and is used to estimate the stress at the sensor and object interface by solving the stress inverse problem analytically. Results are presented to illustrate the use of the microsensor to estimate the contact traction distribution due to a spherical indenter of radius 500 μm.},

	abstract = {This preliminary study investigated behaviorally the performance of a sample of young twins in a set of classical visuomotor tasks. The assessment was carried out using a small haptic interface used to produce force and record the hand trajectory during the execution of tasks requiring rapid and precise movements. The aim of the study was to evaluate the sensorimotor development across a wide age-range (6-13 years) in which dramatic changes in sensorimotor integration and motor skills occur. A mixed-effect analysis was performed in order to evaluate age-related effects and to check for reduction of residual variability within twins with respect to variability across all pairs of twins. We report both an effect of age and of parenthood when considering reaction times and control of position of the hand under perturbed environment. The ability of tracking a moving target and the velocity of information processing show a dependence on age but not on the parenthood factor. This study validates the methodology used to investigate the age effects on the motor behavior of children and promises to provide new insights in twin-studies.},

Both by actuating two piezoelectric actuators sequentially from one side to the opposite side and by controlling amplitude-modulated input excitation frequency from zero to the 1st mode of the resonant frequency of a thin plate, a user can feel a smoother directional vibrotactile flows on his/her palm as he/she touches the surface of the thin plate. Experimental results and a user study show that the proposed vibrotactile flow is smoother than the vibrotactile flow that can be generated by the traditional apparent tactile movement and phantom sensation generation methods.

	abstract = {When, in visual and haptic search, a target is easily found among distractors, this is called a pop-out effect. The target feature is then believed to be salient, and the search is performed in a parallel way. We investigated this effect with movable stimuli in a haptic search task. The task was to find a movable ball among anchored distractors or the other way round. Results show that reaction times were independent of the number of distractors if the movable ball was the target but increased with the number of items if the anchored ball was the target. Analysis of hand movements revealed a parallel search strategy, shorter movement paths, a higher average movement speed, and a narrower direction distribution with the movable target, as compared with a more detailed search for an anchored target. Taken together, these results show that a movable object pops out between anchored objects and this indicates that movability is a salient object feature. Vibratory signals resulting from the movable ball were found to be a reasonable explanation regarding the sensation responsible for the pop-out of movability.},

A custom-made high-resolution friction force sensor, able to resolve milli-newton forces, was used to record those fluctuations as well as the net, low-frequency components of the interaction force. Measurements show that the fluctuations of the sliding force are highly non-stationary. Despite their randomness, force spectra averages reveal regularities. With a smooth, flat, but not mirror-finish, surface the background noise follows a 1/f trend. Recordings made with pure-tone sinusoidal gratings reveal complexities in the interaction between a finger and a surface. The fundamental frequency is driven by the periodicity of the gratings and harmonics follow a non-integer power-law decay that suggests strong nonlinearities in the fingertip interaction. The results are consistent with the existence of a multiplicity of simultaneous and rapid stick-slip relaxation oscillations. Results have implications for high fidelity haptic rendering and biotribology.},

The proposed method was tested experimentally in time and frequency domains by means of an excitation motor attached at the user side of the device. The excitation motor enabled evaluation of the algorithms with smooth trajectories and high frequencies, which cannot be generated by user hand.

To scale the utility demonstrated for small icon sets to larger ones, we need efficient strategies to help users learn subtle distinctions among stimuli, in a modality for which they may not hold detailed descriptive percepts. This paper investigates the effect of naming haptic stimuli - i.e. explicitly creating a linguistic marker - on the accuracy with which users are able to identify, distinguish, and recall stimuli. We conducted a between-subjects experiment using 60 participants equally divided among three naming conditions: no names, pre-selected non-descriptive names, and self-selected names. The experiment examined the impact of naming strategy on the ability of participants to identify stimuli in a nonverbal matching test, and on remembering stimulus names. For this challenging task and the degree of learning afforded, naming did not significantly impact accuracy of matching stimuli to meanings for all participants. However, more than twice of many of those allowed to choose names reported the ability to remember and distinguish stimuli than those required to use non-descriptive names, and many participants felt that the names were useful. Of middle-performing participants, the self-selected names group performed significantly better than the non-descriptive names group, and appeared to progress more quickly in learning. We summarize evidence for a trend that might widen with refined naming strategies and more extensive learning.},

Some factors that may have influenced these results include the speed and the complexity of the tested motions, the type of tactile actuators and drive signals used, and inconsistencies in joint angle estimation due to Euler angle gimbal lock.

Historically, the majority of the research on this topic has focused on interactions in the perception of stationary stimuli, but given that the majority of stimuli in the world move, an important question concerns the extent to which principles derived from stationary stimuli also apply to moving stimuli. A key finding emerging from recent work with moving stimuli is that our perception of stimulus movement in one modality is frequently, and unavoidably, modulated by the concurrent movement of stimuli in other sensory modalities. Visual motion has a particularly strong influence on the perception of auditory and tactile motion. These behavioral results are now being complemented by the results of neuroimaging studies that have pointed out the existence of both modality-specific motion-processing areas and areas involved in processing motion in more than one sense. The challenge for the future will be to develop novel experimental paradigms that can integrate behavioral and neuroscientific approaches in order to refine our understanding of multisensory contributions to the perception of movement.},

The unique point of the device is that all components including the motors and sensors are fabricated using non ferromagnetic materials to realize operation in a strong magnetic field. The device consists of an operation handle, two electrostatic motor units and two optical force sensors, and is an improved version of our previous development. The new device has stiffer platforms, improved force sensors, and newly fabricated driving electronics. The employed electrostatic motor is one of the strongest electrostatic actuators and can generate thrust force of several newtons. To operate a motor unit, two three-phase signals are required and they have to be amplified to over 1 {kV.} In our previous development, the signals were amplified by six large commercial amplifiers, which was not practical enough considering the portability of the system. This work developed an original driving electronics for the motor using Field Programmable Gate Array ({FPGA)} and step-up transformers to reduce the system size. The device was implemented on one of the major haptic toolkits, {CHAI} {3D.} To be able to run sample impedance-type programs without any modifications, we implemented our device to behave like impedance-type on {CHAI} {3D.}},

We investigate the efficacy of a skin stretch device for artificially relaying proprioception during a spring discrimination task, with the goal of enabling the task to be achieved in the absence of vision. In this study, intact users perceive the location of a virtual prosthetic limb using each of four sensory conditions: Vision, Proprioception, Skin Stretch, and Skin Stretch with Vision. For the conditions with skin stretch, a haptic device stretches the forearm skin by an amount proportional to the angular rotation of a virtual prosthetic limb. Sensory condition was not found to significantly influence task performance, exploration methods, or perceived usefulness. We conclude that, in the absence of vision, artificial skin stretch could be used by prosthesis wearers to obtain position/motion information and identify the behavior of a spring.},

However, the effect of the evident latency in interaction has been completely neglected in earlier investigations of touchscreen interaction. In this study we examined the effect of tactile feedback latencies on the usability of a touchscreen keypad. We used a realistic use case for number and character keypads; users entered three-number sequences and short sentences using the virtual buttons on the touch display. The experiments differed from each other in terms of the tactile feedback type (press-only or for press and release) and the keypad layout (number or {QWERTY).} The results were unexpected, but consistent in all three experiments: The performance did not drop significantly within the latency values used. However, the users evaluated the keypad with the shortest feedback latency more pleasant to use compared to others. We can conclude that latency makes the user experience worse, even though performance does not decrease significantly.},

The second investigated haptic guidance which waxed and waned as the user violated program rules by varying amounts. The third experiment investigated whether this latter artificial guidance would inhibit the user's free will by taking control out of their hands. The results showed that a significant improvement in both accuracy and speed was achieved by the introduction of haptics in all experiments. It also found that the haptic guidance did not take control away from the user and that they had significantly more control than with conventional warning methods. These experiments were not aimed at learning, or retention of skill, but on using haptics as an aid to improve performance during a task.},

This paper aims to build a robust model for the perceived intensities of mobile device vibrations, which can be used by engineers and application designers. We carried out two psychophysical experiments using absolute magnitude estimation procedures. In Exp. I, we investigated the effects of vibration direction and device weight on the perceived intensity of mobile device vibrations. Only the vibration direction was found to be a statistically significant factor, showing the highest perceived intensities along the height direction of a mobile device. In Exp. {II}, we measured the perceived intensities of vibrations with various amplitudes and frequencies along the three vibration directions. Then, for each direction, a psychophysical magnitude function and equal sensation contours were constructed based on Stevens\&amp;\#8217; power law. In addition, we found a monotonic relationship between the physical power of vibration absorbed by the hand and the resulting perceived intensity. This suggests that the former, which is greatly easier to acquire in practice, is a reliable predictor of the latter. We expect that the results of this study can provide knowledge about the perceptual strength of vibrations that engineers and applications developers will find useful.},

Several models exist that explain expressive variations over the course of a performance, for example in terms of phrase structure, or musical accent. Often however expressive markings are written explicitly in the score to guide performers. We present a modelling framework for musical expression that is especially suited to model the influence of such markings, along with any other information from the musical score. In two separate experiments, we demonstrate the modelling framework for both predictive and explanatory modelling. Together with the results of these experiments, we discuss our perspective on computational modelling of musical expression in relation to musical creativity.},

	abstract = {Abstract We present interdisciplinary research undertaken for the development of an ‘augmented’ string quartet. Hardware and software components were especially designed to enable mixed acoustic/electronic music where bow gestures drive digital sound processes. Precisely, inertial motion sensors and a bow force sensor were added to each musician's bow, and dedicated modules allowed forthe wireless data transmission to an on-line gesture analysis system. Prior to the performance, a research phase was performed to evaluate qualitatively the variability of the gesture data. Recording sessions of both gesture and audio data were carried out with a professional string quartet. The music material included a set of prototypical musical phrases containing various bowing styles and playing techniques as well as a complete music composition. The analysis of the recorded sessions allowed us to compare the consistency within and between players. While a given player was found to be generally consistent, the comparison between players revealed significant gesture idiosyncrasies. These results helped us to adapt a real-time gesture analysis system called the gesture follower. This tool was successful to automatically synchronize the live performance with electronic sound transformation in two concerts. A quantitative assessment is reported on a specific section of the piece, illustrating the accuracy and the types of errors encountered.},

Haptic feedback is a key feature for every surgery simulator for the training of hand-eye coordination. To address the need for higher fidelity and complexity in an endoscopic simulator, we have designed a new haptic interface, instrumented a clinical endoscope and integrated it with a software simulation for colonoscopy. The proposed haptic interface provides high translational force and rotational torque with combined electrical motors and passive brakes. This paper presents the evaluation of the haptic interface. Experimental analyzes are performed for characterization and performance evaluation. A model-based feed-forward control is implemented and the results show that the control successfully compensates for the device dynamics and nonlinearities such as Coulomb and viscous friction.},

However, understandings of the perceptual relations between amplitude-modulated vibrations are not comprehensive yet. In this paper, we present a perceptual analysis on the identifying characteristics of amplitude-modulated vibrations and their perceptual relations. We estimated the perceptual dissimilarities among one carrier and seven amplitude-modulated sinusoidal vibrations (150-Hz carrier frequency; seven modulation frequencies in 1-80 Hz) in a psychophysical experiment. The dissimilarity scores were inspected using multi-dimensional scaling to obtain an appropriate perceptual space. The optimal perceptual space was two-dimensional, where the vibration points exhibited a circular formation. The analysis showed that the pulse-like low-frequency sensation of an amplitude-modulated vibration increased for very low modulation frequencies (1-10 Hz), then decreased for higher modulation frequencies (10-80 Hz), and eventually converged to the smooth vibrational sensation of the 150-Hz carrier signal. It also suggested that the envelope waveform is primary information for the discrimination of amplitude-modulated signals, instead of their spectral energy distributions. These findings can contribute to the design of perceptually salient and distinctive vibrotactile signals using amplitude modulation.},

	abstract = {Abstract Listening to sounds or music is not a homogeneous act of grasping meanings by hearing. Yet it is often portrayed as such, especially when the intentional stance of a listener is overlooked. This paper distinguishes listening as the action-oriented intentional activity of making sense of the world. It is proposed that the multifaceted and heterogeneous nature of ‘understanding by listening’ can be outlined in terms of distinct modes of listening. Building upon previous accounts, a revised taxonomy of nine listening modes (reflexive, kinaesthetic, connotative, causal, empathetic, functional, semantic, reduced and critical listening) is proposed and illustrated by examples. Modes refer to different constituents of meaning-creation in the process of listening. In the taxonomy, they are schematically arranged into three levels (experiential, denotative and reflective). The theoretical framework of this revised taxonomy utilizes an embodied cognition paradigm. The experiential basis of meaning in listening is theoretically conceived of as emerging resonances between experiential patterns of sensations, structured patterns of recurrent sensorimotor experiences (action–sound couplings) and the projection of action-relevant mental images. The proposed taxonomy of listening modes is discussed in terms of its implications for perception and cognition research on sounds and music.},

Thorough discussion and appraisal of the meaning and role of annotation in this context leads to our conclusion that: (i) full automation is not possible due to the lack of a ‘ground truth’ and the absence of semantic comprehension on the side of the computer, (ii) {MIR} can nevertheless play a valuable role by providing human annotators with tools for interactive annotation. We present two possible approaches to interactive annotation applied to compositions of acousmatic music, namely John Chowning's Turenas and Denis Smalley's Wind Chimes. We also discuss the potential impact of such semi-automatic annotation on the theoretical consideration and practice of acousmatic music.},

It was observed that the passivity condition for multiple ports may lead to some oscillations in some coordinate directions even though total energy is positive. The passivity condition, therefore, needs to be applied to each orthogonal coordinate. For guaranteeing stability in each orthogonal coordinate, the {EBA} is applied. For multiple-dof haptic interaction, however, the {EBA} in each coordinate may cause a problem that the direction of the rendered force vector is distorted. This problem can easily be solved by projecting the direction of the rendered force vector on its original direction. The validity of the proposed algorithm is shown by some experiments.},

Employing von Frey hairs from 0.41 to 15.1 g, we first characterized the percent response at each stimulus intensity. A smooth log-linear relationship was observed, with a median 50\% threshold at 1.97 g (95\% confidence limits, 1.12–3.57 g). Subsequently, we applied a paradigm using stimulus oscillation around the response threshold, which allowed more rapid, efficient measurements. Median 50\% threshold by this up-down method was 2.4 g (1.81–2.76). Correlation coefficient between the two methods was 0.91. In neuropathic rats, good intra- and inter-observer reproducibility was found for the up-down paradigm; some variability was seen in normal rats, attributable to extensive testing. Thresholds in a sizable group of neuropathic rats showed insignificant variability over 20 days. After 50 days, 61\% still met strict neuropathy criteria, using survival analysis. Threshold measurement using the up-down paradigm, in combination with the neuropathic pain model, represents a powerful tool for analyzing the effects of manipulations of the neuropathic pain state.},

	abstract = {This paper introduces a distributed haptic control architecture that can render direct interaction between users in addition to cooperative manipulation of virtual objects. The proposed architecture integrates remote dynamic proxies and peer-to-peer wave-based communications. Remote dynamic proxies are avatars of users at peer sites with motion governed by second order dynamics laws. They render physically-based motion of the distant users in the presence of update discontinuities caused by packet transmission limitations. They also enable users to touch their far away peers directly. The remote dynamic proxies are integrated with peer-to-peer wave-based communications by using wave variable controllers to connect the distributed copies of the shared virtual object, and to connect the users to their remote dynamic proxies. The proposed distributed control architecture is compared via experiments to peer-to-peer haptic cooperation with wave variable time delay compensation. The results illustrate that remote dynamic proxies with wave-based communications: (1) improve position coherency between the distributed copies of the shared virtual object; (2) render mass more faithfully in the presence of network delay; and (3) permit users to interact with each other directly in addition to enabling them to cooperatively manipulate the shared virtual object.},

In this paper we describe a prototype system designed to enrich the experience of music for the deaf by enhancing sensory input of information via channels other than in-air audio reception by the ear. The system has two main components-a vibrating {'Haptic} Chair' and a computer display of informative visual effects that correspond to features of the music. The Haptic Chair provides sensory input of vibrations via touch. This system was developed based on an initial concept guided by information obtained from a background survey conducted with deaf people from multi-ethnic backgrounds and feedback received from two profoundly deaf musicians. A formal user study with 43 deaf participants suggested that the prototype system enhances the musical experience of a deaf person. All of the users preferred either the Haptic Chair alone (54\%) or the Haptic Chair with the visual display (46\%). The prototype system, especially the Haptic Chair was so enthusiastically received by our subjects that it is possible this system might significantly change the way the deaf community experiences music.},

One of the challenges in the design is the selection of appropriate boundary conditions and the piezo configurations (location and orientation) on the screen for achieving optimum performance within the limits of human haptic perception. To investigate the trade-offs in our design, we developed a finite element model of the screen and four piezo actuators attached to its surface in {ABAQUS.} The model utilizes the well-known Hooke’s law between stress and strain extended by piezoelectric coupling. After selecting the appropriate boundary condition for the screen based on the range of vibration frequencies detectable by a human finger, the optimum configuration for the piezo patches is determined by maximizing the vibration amplitude of the screen for a unit micro Coulomb charge applied to each piezo patch. The results of our study suggest that the piezo patches should be placed close to the clamped sides of the screen where the boundary conditions are applied.},

	abstract = {Sliding a probe over a textured surface generates a rich collection of vibrations that one can easily use to create a mental model of the surface. Haptic virtual environments attempt to mimic these real interactions, but common haptic rendering techniques typically fail to reproduce the sensations that are encountered during texture exploration. Past approaches have focused on building a representation of textures using a priori ideas about surface properties. Instead, this paper describes a process of synthesizing probe-surface interactions from data recorded from real interactions. We explain how to apply the mathematical principles of Linear Predictive Coding ({LPC)} to develop a discrete transfer function that represents the acceleration response under specific probe-surface interaction conditions. We then use this predictive transfer function to generate unique acceleration signals of arbitrary length. In order to move between transfer functions from different probe-surface interaction conditions, we develop a method for interpolating the variables involved in the texture synthesis process. Finally, we compare the results of this process with real recorded acceleration signals, and we show that the two correlate strongly in the frequency domain.},

The virtual reality supported balance training relieved the physiotherapist from strenuous work, besides, also enabled rehabilitation treatment on individuals home and functional balance ability assessment. However, adding a haptic floor to the virtual reality balance training enhanced the approach to the postural response training and assessment. We have developed a two degrees of freedom, position controlled, haptic floor plates providing postural perturbations according to the collisions with obstacles in the virtual environment. The subject generated a postural response to stabilize the body during balance training. Such task represents for the subject with stroke a serious challenge. However, the standing frame prevented the possibility to fall. The virtual reality supported balance training with haptic floor was so far carried out in healthy individuals and tested in single subject after stroke. A basic response characteristic of haptic floor was examined. The preliminary results demonstrated a sufficient dynamics of the haptic floor and great acceptability among the participating subjects. Thus the additional haptic feedback in goal based balance training may contribute to the improvement of subject's functional balance and postural abilities and so increase the quality of life. However, to confirm the clinical applicability of the haptic floor in balance training and evaluation of postural responses, a further study including clinical tests within a larger group of stroke population should be carried out.},

It was found that simple directions were easier to identify than landmarks or actions. The identification of landmarks or actions improved when information about their meaning was available. We discuss implications for the design and development of vibrotactile navigational patterns.},

The tactile display is an array of 4×4 vertically moving pins which can simulate the shape of small scale features. Its small size and low mass allow users to explore virtual surfaces freely and intuitively. The evaluation method consisted of measuring the orientation discrimination threshold for virtual surfaces with sinusoidal profiles. The threshold was compared with the threshold obtained using a non-actuated tactile display of equal spatial resolution and with the threshold obtained using the bare finger to explore real surfaces. This comparison was done to evaluate the quality of the rendered virtual surfaces, the performance of the device as a control system and the efficiency of the tactile rendering algorithm. This study also measured the speed and normal force during the tactile exploration that allowed investigation of the exploration strategies used when touching through normal indentation displays and through the bare finger. Furthermore they are the necessary interaction parameters for assessing the bandwidth and force output of the device.},

Typical applications for haptic collaboration range from the manipulation and handling of heavy and large objects as required in industrial settings, the guidance of human limbs in rehabilitation, the assistance of humans in walking or performing complex manipulation tasks, the teaching of motor skills, to social interaction with virtual agents. This workshop will focus on haptic collaboration in human-X constellations where X stands for human, robot, or agent.

This arm could be touched or not during the presentation of the tactile stimuli. We found that when the participants saw a finger touching the arm on the screen, their responses to the tactile stimuli presented on the left and on the right arm were faster than when the arm on the screen was approached but not touched. Critically, we did not find any illusion of ownership related to the hand seen on the screen.

Remote haptic virtual environments ({VE)} allow multiple users to interact in the same virtual space to accomplish tasks. Combining these ideas, it is possible to apply a remote {VE} to connect skilled trainers with remote trainees for training. In this paper we examined guided haptic training as an interaction method where one user guides another user through a {VR} simulation. We considered interaction with virtual soft objects, which were pressed and deformed. Within a remote {VE} for guided haptic training, network factors such as delay could influence how the guided user perceives object softness. In this paper, we examined how incongruent delays between the streams of visual and haptic information affect this perception. We found that when haptic information was delayed 133.33 ms beyond visual information there was a statistically significant difference in the perception of object softness. These preliminary observations can be used to locate a threshold for applying to future remote guided {VE} training tools.},

	abstract = {Rapid sequential taps delivered first to one location and then to another on the skin create the somatosensory illusion that the tapping is occurring at intermediate locations between the actual stimulus sites, as if a small rabbit were hopping along the skin from the first site to the second (called the “cutaneous rabbit”). Previous behavioral studies have attributed this illusion to the early unimodal somatosensory body map. A functional magnetic resonance imaging study recently confirmed the association of the illusion with somatotopic activity in the primary somatosensory cortex. Thus, the cutaneous rabbit illusion has been confined to one's own body. In the present paper, however, we show that the cutaneous rabbit can “hop out of the body” onto an external object held by the subject. We delivered rapid sequential taps to the left and right index fingers. When the subjects held a stick such that it was laid across the tips of their index fingers and received the taps via the stick, they reported sensing the illusory taps in the space between the actual stimulus locations (i.e., along the stick). This suggests that the cutaneous rabbit effect involves not only the intrinsic somatotopic representation but also the representation of the extended body schema that results from body–object interactions.},

This paper introduces a new method for cursor navigation using the Phantom Omni force-feedback device. The newly proposed workbox is designed to aid the operator with coarse navigation of the cursor and improve target selection. The proposed method can significantly reduce the effect of target distracters, which have been a major hindrance to the development of haptic assistance in graphical user interfaces ({GUI).} The workbox has shown to significantly improve computer access for operators with a limited range of movement by giving them the ability to navigate all of a computer screen.},

The measured root mean square ({RMS)} error in estimating contact force is about 0.2 N, which is suitable for examining subtle human behaviors, such as applying cosmetics. We demonstrated the possible usage of the contact force sensor in combination with a three-axis acceleration sensor. The proposed sensor system is sufficiently small and light when fixed on the fingernail, and is considered to have little constraining or modifying effect on usual haptic behaviors. It should be widely useful for evaluating human haptic procedures in psychological research or ergonomic studies.},

	abstract = {Electric {DC} motors that convert electric current to torque are the most common type of actuators used in haptic interfaces. However, high currents necessary to deliver large haptic forces can generate heat in the electromagnetic coils, and in the extreme can cause malfunctions due to overheating. It is therefore necessary to add thermal protection mechanisms to limit the output current. While this is a common feature of haptic devices, it is not clear what makes a superior current limiting method or what effect such limits have on haptic perception. The current work evaluates three methods for current limiting: limit output to zero, limit output to a safe steady-state current, limit output current in linear proportion to temperature. Using both quantitative and qualitative metrics, these are compared to a control case with no current limit. Human subjects use one finger of a multi finger haptic device to perform a psychophysical thresholding experiment designed to measure human perception of small haptic effects, while forcing the device to heat up. All methods are shown to effectively regulate temperature and show no statistically significant difference in psychophysical threshold value. Users show a slight preference for the linear method, while the zero output method requires less time spent interacting with current limited conditions.},

	abstract = {Collaborative tabletop systems can employ direct touch, where people's real arms and hands manipulate objects, or indirect input, where people are represented on the table with digital embodiments. The input type and the resulting embodiment dramatically influence tabletop interaction: in particular, the touch avoidance that naturally governs people's touching and crossing behavior with physical arms is lost with digital embodiments. One result of this loss is that people are less aware of each others' arms, and less able to coordinate actions and protect personal territories. To determine whether there are strategies that can influence group interaction on shared digital tabletops, we studied augmented digital arm embodiments that provide tactile feedback or movement alterations when people touched or crossed arms. The study showed that both augmentation types changed people's behavior (people crossed less than half as often) and also changed their perception (people felt more aware of the other person's arm, and felt more awkward when touching). This work shows how groupware designers can influence people's interaction, awareness, and coordination abilities when physical constraints are absent.},

	abstract = {In this paper, maneuverability measure of master control devices considering the musculo-skeletal model of operators is proposed. The original maneuverability measure of master arms considering the operator dynamics is extended by introducing a muscle tension space instead of the joint torque space of an operator so that the maneuverability is evaluated under a constant muscle stress condition which is related to muscle fatigue. Unidirectionality of muscle tension forces as well as the gravity effects acting on the master device and the operator arm are explicitly considered to get a correct evaluation. As a numerical example, the effect of a movable armrest installed on a master arm is evaluated based on the proposed measure. It is shown that the armrest is effective to reduce muscle fatigue by not only lowering the gravity loads for the operator but also reducing the gripping force necessary to maneuver the device. Experiments are also conducted to verify the result of this numerical example.},

	abstract = {The vibration behavior of acoustic music instruments, as perceived through touch, is known to play an important role in the interaction between performers and music instruments. This research explores the relevance and utility of including a tactile simulation of this behavior in computer music interfaces, in a snapshot taken during early learning, and including tradeoffs of using this channel for other information. Vibrotactile ({VT)} renderings of different types of sounds were presented to subjects via a handle fitted with vibration actuators. Subjects (1) evaluated consistency of the sound with the {VT} rendering, (2) identified from a “lineup” the {VT} rendering that did not match a sound, and (3) provided data on how inclusion of {VT} cues in a rhythm-tapping task affected perception quality of the {VT} rendering. For the last, a distractor task allowed us to measure both the usability of the cues and the degradation in perception of the {VT} rendering. All renderings were either played directly through vibration transducers, or first altered by modifying the sound's frequency content. {VT} playback was delivered at intensities similar to those experienced in traditional acoustic music instruments. Subjects indicated that specific alterations to the original, direct {VT} rendering were consistent with the source sound more often than the original was, and were able to differentiate between correct and incorrect renderings of a source sound. However, the latter ability was masked when subjects were provided with and able to effectively utilize extra {VT} cues added to the {VT} feedback to improve their performance, suggesting that the {VT} cues were of greater utility than the {VT} mimicking. We discuss the relevance of these findings on the design of computer music interfaces.},

From a physiological point of view, the production of a simple musical tone relies on the control of the pressure at the lips, the contact force on the mouthpiece, and the oral articulatory gestures and configurations. Whereas previous studies described the magnitude of these control parameters in the quasi-static regime of the oscillation, the present investigation focuses on their temporal evolution and interrelation. Intra-oral pressure, mouthpiece force, facial muscular activity of two groups of muscles, and the radiated sound were recorded from three professional players performing isolated and articulated tones with three different dynamics. Results showed that the experimental conditions affected the amount and location of variability in the performance, and the behaviour of intra-oral pressure at note initiation. All together, this suggests that different dynamics and sequencing may cause a reorganization of the mechanisms underlying the production of a tone.},

The transducer is a 5×6 array based on custom electromechanical mini-solenoid designed and optimized for reduced encumbrance and lightweight. The realized actuator has a diameter of 2.4mm and is capable of delivering a maximum force of {73mN.} In the first section we present the electro-mechanical design, the optimization and the first experimental test of a prototype for the new transducer. In the second section we show the electronic design and a strategy for controlling arrays of transducers with a reduced number of connectors. This principle is based on active matrix addressing of {LCD} displays.},

Haptic simulation of grasping, with the rendering of contact forces resulting from the manipulation of virtual objects, requires realistic yet interactive models of hand mechanics. This paper presents a model for interactive simulation of the skeletal and elastic properties of a human hand, allowing haptic grasping of virtual objects with soft finger contact. The novel aspects of the model consist of a simple technique to couple skeletal and elastic elements, an efficient dynamics solver in the presence of joints and contact constraints, and an algorithm that connects the simulation to a haptic device.},

This review focuses on haptic methods that display data. The hypothesis is that haptic devices can be used to present information, and consequently, the user gains quantitative, qualitative, or holistic knowledge about the presented data. Not only is this useful for users who are blind or partially sighted (who can feel line graphs, for instance), but also the haptic modality can be used alongside other modalities, to increase the amount of variables being presented, or to duplicate some variables to reinforce the presentation. Over the last 20 years, a significant amount of research has been done in haptic data presentation; e.g., researchers have developed force feedback line graphs, bar charts, and other forms of haptic representations. However, previous research is published in different conferences and journals, with different application emphases. This paper gathers and collates these various designs to provide a comprehensive review of designs for haptic data visualization. The designs are classified by their representation: Charts, Maps, Signs, Networks, Diagrams, Images, and Tables. This review provides a comprehensive reference for researchers and learners, and highlights areas for further research.},

We propose the addition of a tactile feedback mechanism for a pointing-stick-type ({PS)} input device. In this study, we describe a method for enabling virtual active touch with a cursor on the screen operated by the {PS-type} tactile interface without actual touch movement. First, to validate our concept, we compared tactile detection capabilities of roughness information represented by the {PS-type} tactile interface and the interface with actual touch movement. The experimental results showed that the {PS-type} tactile interface exhibited almost the same ability as the interface involving actual touch movement. We also found that the force-to-velocity scaling factor of the cursor movement had a significant influence on the roughness detection capability of the interface. In addition, to apply our method to devices having small screens, such as mobile phones, we tried to restrict the cursor velocity in proportion to the object size that appears on the screen. The experimental results showed that the {PS-type} tactile interface can represent almost the same roughness information as the original object size.},

	abstract = {Within the {HapCath} - haptic catheter - project an assistive system for interventional catheterizations has been developed. Conventional navigation during catheterization is done by direct manipulation of a handle at a guide wire's proximal end. With the aid of X-ray imaging the corresponding movement of the distal tip within the patient can be monitored. Depending on the practical experience of the medical expert and on the varying complexity of the treatment, the procedure differs in duration and X-ray exposure dose of up to 300\%. The aim of the {HapCath-System} is to reduce duration and exposure dose by simplifying the procedure. The implemented method is to measure the contact forces at the distal tip of the guide wire and feed these measured forces back onto the proximal end of the guide wire to enable tactile feedback and allow for haptic control of the guide wire. The system gives exact measures for the contact force of the guide wire's tip and vessel walls to the physician. The demonstration system of {HapCath} includes an artificial artery system, within these the user will be able to maneuver the haptic guide wire and will be able to recognize different types of plaques by touching the calcifications with the guide wire tip. The system is set up to experience different levels of haptic assistance. The discrete tasks of catheterizations can be performed with visual or haptic feedback either, or with visual and haptic feedback simultaneously.},

	abstract = {The design of a digital musical instrument is often informed by the needs of the first performance or composition. Following the initial performances, the designer frequently confronts the question of how to build a larger community of performers and composers around the instrument. Later musicians are likely to approach the instrument on different terms than those involved in the design process, so design decisions that promote a successful first performance will not necessarily translate to broader uptake. This article addresses the process of bringing an existing instrument to a wider musical community, including how musician feedback can be used to refine the instrument's design without compromising its identity. As a case study, the article presents the magnetic resonator piano, an electronically augmented acoustic grand piano that uses electromagnets to induce vibrations in the strings. After initial compositions and performances using the instrument, feedback from composers and performers guided refinements to the design, laying the groundwork for a collaborative project in which six composers wrote pieces for the instrument. The pieces exhibited a striking diversity of style and technique, including instrumental techniques never considered by the designer. The project, which culminated in two concert performances, demonstrates how a new instrument can acquire a community of musicians beyond those initially involved.},

Humans vary their impedance to reduce contact forces, to increase positional control, and to stabilize unstable dynamics. The neuromuscular system modulates overall limb impedance by strategically selecting appropriate limb configurations and by selective activation of musculature. To date, haptic interfaces neither respond to nor measure these effects. We seek a real-time measurement technique to estimate user impedance, with the hope of enabling variable impedance based control of telerobots and haptic environments. We propose that such a measure might be generated through the introduction of controlled vibrations to the user through a haptic device. A model for such a system and its implications on device design is described. The results of preliminary study using a prototype device are compared to reference measurements of user stiffness and grip force.},

	abstract = {A method for 6-{DOF} haptic rendering of isosurface geometry embedded within sampled volume data is presented. The algorithm uses a quasi-static formulation of motion constrained by multiple contacts to simulate rigid-body interaction between a haptically controlled virtual tool (proxy), represented as a point-sampled surface, and volumetric isosurfaces. Unmodified volume data, such as computed tomography or magnetic resonance images, can be rendered directly with this approach, making it particularly suitable for applications in medical or surgical simulation. The algorithm was implemented and tested on a variety of volume data sets using several virtual tools with different geometry. As the constraint-based algorithm permits simulation of a massless proxy, no artificial mass or inertia were needed nor observed. The speed and transparency of the algorithm allowed motion to be responsive to extremely stiff contacts with complex virtualized geometry. Despite rendering stiffnesses that approach the physical limits of the interfaces used, the simulation remained stable through haptic interactions that typically present a challenge to other rendering methods, including wedging, prying, and hooking.},

The curvature of the texture is encoded in a normal map which allows the computation of the curvature and local changes of orientation, according to the mouse position and direction. A user evaluation was conducted to compare the optically-induced haptic feedback of the curvature-based approach versus the original depth-based approach based on depth maps. Results showed that users, in addition to being able to efficiently recognize simulated bumps and holes with the curvature-based approach, were also able to discriminate shapes with lower frequency and amplitude.},

In spite of a large variety in terms of instrumentation, a bass instrument can be found in most music genres. Thus, the bass track can be analysed to explore stylistic similarities between music genres. We present an extensive set of transcription-based high-level features related to rhythm and tonality that allows one to characterize basslines on a symbolic level. Traditional classification techniques based on pattern recognition techniques and audio features are compared with rule-based classification and classification based on the similarity between basslines. We use a novel dataset that consists of typical basslines of 13 music genres from different cultural backgrounds for evaluation purposes. Finally, the genre confusion results obtained in the experiments are examined by musicologists. Our study shows that several known stylistic relationships between music genres could be verified that way by classifying typical basslines. We could achieve a highest accuracy value of 64.8\% for the genre classification solely based on repetitive basslines of a song.},

	abstract = {Virtual coupling is commonly used to maintain stability of penalty-based haptic rendering. However, due to dozens of design parameters involved in the dynamics and force model, to increase transparency while maintaining stability using virtual coupling remains a challenge for 6-Degree-of-Freedom ({DOF)} haptic rendering. Using an equivalent-angle analysis, we transform 3-{DOF} rotation into 1-{DOF} rotation, thereby transforming the 6-{DOF} dynamics into six 1-{DOF} dynamics. For each 1-{DOF} dynamics, a damped vibration model is proposed to analyze the computation of the `graphic tool'. The equilibrium position/angle is defined to analyze the convergence of numerical integration. With this approach, we can improve the transparency of 6-{DOF} haptic rendering in both free space and constraint space by experimentally determining only two parameters: the integration time step and the number of integrations in each simulation loop. Using this method, we can improve the coupling stiffness to fully exploit the display capability of the haptic device and maintain the stability of the haptic rendering.},

The thermal diffusivity of a material is a parameter that controls the rate with which heat is extracted from the hand when it touches an object of that material. This rate of heat extraction is an important cue for distinguishing materials and recognising objects by means of touch. We have measured the ability of human observers to discriminate between different rates of heat extraction. This was done using a device that displayed different transient temperature profiles to the finger. In different conditions, subjects were repeatedly asked to select the faster-cooling of two stimuli. The discrimination threshold was around 43\% of the extraction rate. A rate that was twice as slow also yielded twice the absolute discrimination threshold. When we halved the temperature difference between beginning and end of the stimulus, the threshold did not change as much. This shows that subjects can use the rate of heat extraction as a cue and that they can discriminate between materials if their thermal diffusivities are at least 43\% apart.},

We present extensive results on a database containing 35 h of originally recorded music covering diverse genres as popular, classical, and Jazz music. In the pre-processing, adjustment of reference pitch classes, {dB(A)-weighting}, band-pass-filter type selection, frequency selection, and gating time are discussed in detail. In addition to traditional correlation-based approaches we employ a data-driven model using Support Vector Machines. Overall, the proposed features enhance correlation results and their combination boosts data-driven audio key determination accuracy. The latter approach based on learnt models significantly outperforms correlation-based determination by 5.0\% and 6.7\% absolute for the determination of 12 and 24 major and minor keys (clustered or separately), respectively. Maximum accuracy reaches 77.3\% and 62.1\% for these 12 or 24 keys over the diverse recordings.},

For both the software and hardware development it was important to always ensure that the system was flexible enough to cater for the very different conditions that are characteristic of the intended user group. The Soundscraper has been tested with 25 children with good results. An increased attention span was reported, as well as positively surprising reactions from children where the caregivers were unsure whether they could hear at all. The sound synthesis methods, the gesture sensors and the employed parameter mapping were all simple, but they provided a controllable and sufficiently complex sound environment even with limited interaction.

Melodic similarity has been studied by a number of means, sometimes quite contrasting, which lead to important differences in the light of the finding that similarity is dependent on context. Models of melodic similarity based on reduction show that the existence of multiple possible reductions forms a natural basis for similarity to depend on interpretation. Examination of the {MIREX} 2005 data shows wide variations in subjects' judgements of melodic similarity and some evidence that the perceived similarity between two melodies can be influenced by the presence of a third melody. Examples from Mozart suggest that he deliberately exploited the possibilities inherent in recognizing similarity through different interpretations. It is therefore proposed that similarity be thought of not as a distinct and definite function of two melodies but as something created in the minds of those who hear the melodies.},

	title = {Inverse piano technique for studying finger interaction during pressing tasks},
	doi = {10.1109/WHC.2009.4810806},
	abstract = {When a person moves or presses with an individual finger other fingers also produce a force (Kilbreath and Gandevia 1994; Li et al. 2004; Zatsiorsky et al. 2000). Several factors are known to contribute to this response: (1) peripheral mechanical coupling, (2) multi-digit motor units, and (3) diverging central commands. This phenomenon, known as enslaving, has traditionally been studied in isometric pressing tasks. The purpose of this project was to build a device, an Inverse Piano ({IP)}, to study finger interaction in non-isometric pressing tasks. The {IP} allows for fingers to be unexpectedly raised or lowered during pressing tasks. Fingers are perturbed by linear motors located directly under uni-dimensional force sensors, which serve as the "piano keys". Motors are triggered using National Instruments Lab {VIEW.} This allows key position and finger force data to be recorded simultaneously. The {IP} makes possible the studying of several factors on the finger force outcome and coordination. In particular, the following factors can be explored: (a) Finger combination. There are 15 combinations of the key manipulation: four 1-finger tasks (I, M, R, L, where the letters designate the index, middle, ring, and little finger respectively); six 2-finger tasks ({IM}, {IR}, {IL}, {MR}, {ML}, {RL);} four 3-finger tasks ({IMR}, {IML}, {IRL}, {MRL)} and one 4-finger task ({IMRL).} (b) Predictability of the key raising. The options are innumerable but can be roughly classified into three groups: (1) both the sequence and time intervals are unknown to the subjects; (2) the sequence is known but the time intervals are unknown; and (3) both the sequence and time intervals are known in advance, (c) Amplitude of key movement. The {IP} is capable of displacing fingers up to 2 cm, in increments less than 1 mm. (d) The speed of key movement. The {IP} can vary key movement rates of between 2 mm/s to 4,687 mm/s. (e) Resistance of the keys to the external force. The resistance can mimic different mechanical properties,- - e.g. elastic resistance which is proportional to the key displacement, damping resistance proportional to the speed, dry friction, etc. The magnitude of the resistance, e.g. 'stiffness', can also be varied, (f) Feedback with various options: (1) visual feedback on the computer screen, the subject can also see his/her hand; (2) no visual feedback on the screen, however the subject can see his/her hand; and (3) no feedback on the screen, the subject cannot see his/her hand. Thus far experimentation using {IP} has only investigated effects of varying magnitude of displacement. The {IP} also has the potential to be utilized as a rehabilitation device for patients suffering a loss of dexterity and finger strength. It is possible for a variety of programs to be created that would train both finger independence and strength. One such program is illustrated in figure 1 where a target force is given on a computer screen and the patient would be instructed to match the force output of their instructed finger(s) to the target. The {IP} would also make it possible to give very precise quantitative feedback, on various measures of performance, to the clinician as opposed to qualitative feedback that is the staple of most current methods of rehabilitation. The purpose of the demonstration is to show the capabilities of the {IP} as both a research and rehabilitation device. Several custom programs will be written that allow for easy manipulation of variables (i.e. key height, speed of raising, combination of keys raised, target force feedback, etc) so that attendees, with both research and clinician backgrounds, can test the {IP.}},

However, the implementation of conventional tactile sensors is very complex. We develop a simple total-internal-reflection based tactile sensor that measures the shape of the sensor surface from a reflection image of the surface and evaluate its performance. We previously proposed a reconstruction method which solves geometric optical constraints of the sensor surface by optimization, however this method could not meet real-time and accurate reconstruction simultaneously. To solve this problem, in this paper, we propose a new reconstruction method based on the previously proposed one. By reconstruction experiments with simulated reflection images, we found that the proposed method could perform real-time and accurate reconstruction and was applicable to various sensor shapes and robust to feature tracking error and the presence of contact areas on the sensor surface without total-internal-reflection property. Then, we implemented the proposed method on the actual sensor and confirmed that the sensor could perform real-time reconstruction.},

We reveal that 70-80\% of the textures' appeal to human touch can be described on the basis of the sensory and physical factors. We propose two models involving the predictability of textures.

	abstract = {In this work we present {PhyNeSS} - a novel physics-driven neural networks-based surgical simulation system which, for the first time, combines the complexity and accuracy of physics-based non-linear soft tissue models and commercial finite element codes with the high speed of execution of machine learned neural networks. While soft tissue is inherently nonlinear, physics-based simulation of nonlinear tissue behavior with haptic feedback is very challenging as the solution of the coupled nonlinear partial differential equations is iterative and therefore extremely computationally intensive. The major contribution of this paper is that through an unprecedented combination of hard and soft computing methods, it is able to reduce the solution of nonlinear problems to almost the same complexity as solving linear problems. This promises to resolve one of the longest-standing technical challenges of real time surgical simulation. The first phase of the method is a pre-computation phase, in which each node of the organ model, with known linear or nonlinear material properties, is provided with carefully chosen prescribed displacements and the response, computed using commercial finite element software tools, is recorded off-line and stored in a large database. The data in then vastly condensed into a set of coefficients describing neurons of a radial basis function ({RBF)} networks or easier storage and rapid reproduction. During real-time computations, as the surgical tool interacts with the organ models, these neural networks are used to reconstruct the deformation fields as well as the reaction forces at the surgical tool tip. We present simulation results for realistic surgical scenarios with real time force feedback.},

The principal findings of the tests suggest that: (a) the model is able to mirror all the different modes of human tapping behaviour, for reasonably justified settings and (b) the non-linear resonance feature of the model has clear advantages over linear oscillator models in addressing human tapping behaviours related to polyrhythm perception.},

A variety of psychophysical procedures are employed for this purpose, most of which have been adapted from research on the visual and auditory systems. The sensory systems involved in processing haptic information present unique challenges due to the active nature of sensory exploration and these need to be taken into account in designing psychophysical experiments with tactile and haptic displays. In this half-day tutorial we will give an overview of psychophysical methods that can be used to analyze haptic perception, including those associated with measuring thresholds, information transfer and multi-dimensional scaling.

The robotic system consists of a mobile robot and a wearable master robot. The elaborated algorithms allow the robot to precisely recognize the shape, boundaries, movement direction, speed, and distance to the obstacle by means of the laser range finders. The designed tactile belt interface receives the detected information and maps it through the vibrotactile patterns. We designed the patterns in such a way that they convey the obstacle parameters in a very intuitive, robust, and unobtrusive manner. The robot movement direction and speed are governed by the tilt of the user's torso. The sensors embedded into the belt interface measure the user orientation and gestures precisely. Such an interface lets to deeply engage the user into the teleoperation process and to deliver them the tactile perception of the remote environment at the same time. The key point is that the user gets the opportunity to use own arms, hands, fingers for operation of the robotic manipulators and another devices installed on the mobile robot platform. The experimental results of user study revealed the effectiveness of the designed vibration patterns for obstacle parameter presentation. The accuracy in 100\% for detection of the moving object by participants was achieved. We believe that the developed robotic system has significant potential in facilitating the navigation of mobile robot while providing a high degree of immersion into remote space.},

As a learning tool it aims at the development of musical creativity, at the stimulation of embodied understanding of music and at the development of an intimate relationship with the musical instrument. First, the methodological approach is outlined and pedagogical and theoretical backgrounds are discussed. Then, we report on an experiment in which 51 amateur musicians participated. The experiment aimed at probing the application's potential to induce a flow experience and to learn about how participants evaluate the didactic relevance of the Music Paint Machine. Results suggest that the Music Paint Machine has the potential to evoke a flow experience.

In addition, a ferro-fluidic sealing technique was developed to prevent the fluid from leaking and to reduce off-state friction. Experimental results showed that, when compared to a commercial {MR} brake, our 33\% smaller prototype {MR-brake} could generate 2.7 times more torque (10.9 Nm). A 1-{DOF} haptic interface employing the brake enabled crisp virtual wall collision simulations. Significant reduction in the off-state torque was obtained by applying a reverse current pulse to collapse a residual magnetic field in the brake.},

	abstract = {Active touch is often described as yielding “better-quality” information than passive touch. However, some authors have argued that passive-guided movements generate superior percepts due to a reduction in demands on the haptic sensory system. We consider the possibility that passive-guided conditions, as used in most active-passive comparisons, are relatively free from cognitive decision-making, while active conditions involve cognitive loads that are quite high and uncharacteristic of normal sensory processes. Thus studies that purport to show differences in active and passive touch may instead be revealing differences in the amount of cognition involved in active and passive tasks. We hypothesized that passive-guided conditions reduce not the sensory load but the cognitive load that active explorers must bear. To test this hypothesis Blood Oxygen Level Dependent ({BOLD)} activity was measured using functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ({fMRI)} during active and passive-guided fingertip exploration of {2D} raised line drawings. Active movements resulted in greater activation (compared with passive movements) in areas implicated in higher order processes such as monitoring and controlling of goal-directed behavior, attention, execution of movements, and error detection. Passive movements, in contrast, produced greater {BOLD} activity in areas associated with touch perception, length discrimination, tactile object recognition, and efference copy. The activation of a greater number of higher-order processing areas during active relative to passive-guided exploration suggests that instances of passive-guided superiority may not be due to the haptic system’s limited ability to cope with sensory inputs, but rather the restriction imposed by the use of a single finger such that active exploration may require cognitive strategies not demanded in the passive condition. Our findings suggest that previous attempts to compare active and passive touch have, in order to simplify tasks, inadvertently introduced cognitive load at the expense of normal sensory inputs.},

This novel approach is illustrated within a proof-of-concept system: haptic guides are toggled during a path-following task thanks to a mental workload index provided by a {BCI.} The aim of this system is to provide haptic assistance only when the user’s brain activity reflects a high mental workload. A user study conducted with 8 participants shows that our proof-of-concept is operational and exploitable. Results show that activation of haptic guides occurs in the most difficult part of the path-following task. Moreover it allows to increase task performance by 53\% by activating assistance only 59\% of the time. Taken together, these results suggest that {BCI} could be used to determine when the user needs assistance during haptic interaction and to enable haptic guides accordingly.},

	abstract = {Humans can detect and discriminate between fine variations of surface roughness using active touch. It is hitherto believed that roughness perception is mediated mostly by cutaneous and subcutaneous afferents located in the fingertips. However, recent findings have shown that following abolishment of cutaneous afferences resulting from trauma or pharmacological intervention, the ability of subjects to discriminate between textures roughness was not significantly altered. These findings suggest that the somatosensory system is able to collect textural information from other sources than fingertip afference. It follows that signals resulting of the interaction of a finger with a rough surface must be transmitted to stimulate receptor populations in regions far away from the contact. This transmission was characterized by measuring in the wrist vibrations originating at the fingertip and thus propagating through the finger, the hand and the wrist during active exploration of textured surfaces. The spectral analysis of the vibrations taking place in the forearm tissues revealed regularities that were correlated with the scanned surface and the speed of exploration. In the case of periodic textures, the vibration signal contained a fundamental frequency component corresponding to the finger velocity divided by the spatial period of the stimulus. This regularity was found for a wide range of textural length scales and scanning velocities. For non-periodic textures, the spectrum of the vibration did not contain obvious features that would enable discrimination between the different stimuli. However, for both periodic and non-periodic stimuli, the intensity of the vibrations could be related to the microgeometry of the scanned surfaces.},

Although catheters allow for the delivery of fluids and drugs, the deployment of devices, and the acquisition of the measurements, they do not allow clinicians to assess the physical properties of tissue inside the body due to the tissue motion and transmission limitations of the catheter devices, including compliance, friction, and backlash. The goal of this research is to increase the tactile information available to physicians during catheter procedures by providing haptic feedback during palpation procedures. To accomplish this goal, we have developed the first motion compensated actuated catheter system that enables haptic perception of fast moving tissue structures. The actuated catheter is instrumented with a distal tip force sensor and a force feedback interface that allows users to adjust the position of the catheter while experiencing the forces on the catheter tip. The efficacy of this device and interface is evaluated through a psychophyisical study comparing how accurately users can differentiate various materials attached to a cardiac motion simulator using the haptic device and a conventional manual catheter. The results demonstrate that haptics improves a user's ability to differentiate material properties and decreases the total number of errors by 50\% over the manual catheter system.},

Skin stretch has been found to be a reliable means of communicating direction and has potential to be rendered by a compact device. We have conducted experiments exploring the use of lateral skin stretch at the fingertip to communicate direction. A small rubber cylinder was pressed against a subject's fingertip and moved at constant speed to stretch the skin of the fingerpad. The skin was stretched with a range of displacements (0.05 mm-1 mm) and speeds (0.5 mm/s-4 mm/s). Subjects were asked to respond with the direction of the skin stretch, choosing from 4 directions, each separated by 90 degrees. It was found that subjects could perceive skin stretch direction with as little as 0.05 mm of stretch. Direction detection accuracy was found to be dependent upon both the speed and total displacement of the skin stretch. Higher speeds and larger displacements resulted in greater accuracy. High accuracy rates, greater than 95\%, were observed with as little as 0.2 mm of skin stretch and at speeds as slow as 2 mm/s. Accuracy was also found to vary with the direction of the stimulus. This preliminary information will be used to inform the design of a miniature tactile display suitable for use in hand-held electronics.},

Our algorithm implements the stiction model of friction for haptic rendering by utilizing a feedback-stabilized closest point tracking algorithm developed for parametric surfaces. Therefore, our friction rendering algorithm is inherently stable and it can handle surfaces with high curvature. Furthermore, it allows for transitions from sticking to sliding and sliding to sticking, as well as surface to surface transitions, without introducing discontinuous force artifacts. Our algorithm allows for tuning of the friction coefficient during the mode transitions to enable rendering of the Stribeck effect. Thanks to its feedback-stabilized core, it is robust against drift and numerical noise. The algorithm is computationally efficient; its applicability and effectiveness to simulate friction is verified through real-time implementations.},

The simulation allows users to not only see an on-screen computer application, but to actually 'feel' it by touching and manipulating virtual objects.},

However, the methods used have drawbacks for which dynamic haptic matrix display devices have been developed to overcome. As texture is a key component of many tactile diagrams, this study examined the psychophysical response of perceived roughness when square wave gratings were explored with a haptic matrix display by blind and sighted participants. Ridge width, groove width, and contact area were all found to be significant factors contributing to the sensation of roughness. When ridge width was held constant, perceived roughness was a decreasing and approximately linear function of groove width. With groove width held constant, however, perceived roughness was found to be an inverted U-shaped quadratic function of ridge width. The magnitude of the sensation of roughness was found to increase when contact area was increased. Finally, no difference was found between the performance of blind and sighted participants. The resulting information has implications for the effective creation of distinct textures using haptic matrix displays for virtual environments and tactile diagrams.},

	abstract = {The use of multiple unmanned aerial vehicles ({UAVs)} is increasingly being incorporated into a wide range of teleoperation applications. To date, relevant research has largely been focused on the development of appropriate control schemes. In this paper, we extend previous research by investigating how control performance could be improved by providing the teleoperator with haptic feedback cues. First, we describe a control scheme that allows a teleoperator to manipulate the flight of multiple {UAVs} in a remote environment. Next, we present three designs of haptic cue feedback that could increase the teleoperator's environmental awareness of such a remote environment. These cues are based on the {UAVs'} i) velocity information, ii) proximity to obstacles, and iii) a combination of these two sources of information. Finally, we present an experimental evaluation of these haptic cue designs. Our evaluation is based on the teleoperator's perceptual sensitivity to the physical environment inhabited by the multiple {UAVs.} We conclude that a teleoperator's perceptual sensitivity is best served by haptic feedback cues that are based on the velocity information of multiple {UAVs.}},

It consists of a thin layer of bi-elastic fabric placed on the top of a hollow cylinder and tied to an external circular crown which can run outside over the cylinder. The crown can be moved upward and downward by means of a {DC} motor. The crown is connected to the female screw by means of four supports which slide along suitable loops. When the motor pulls down the crown, the fabric is stretched and its apparent stiffness increases. Conversely, when the motor pushes up the crown the fabric is relaxed and it feels softer. Subjects can touch the fabric and feel different levels of softness according to the stretching induced by the motor. Being the fabric deformable in a controlled way under the fingerpad, this new device is able to provide cues for a more reliable and realistic perception. During this demo the device will be controlled to provide subjects with different artificial degrees of softness.},

In this paper we explore the possibility to simultaneously represent, in a comprehensive way, more than one property through the haptic feedback by dividing the feedback into the two components of the haptic sense. Two vibrotactile metaphors for scalar data are described, roughness and transition cue, that can be used in combination with a kinaesthetic representation of either scalar or vector data. The paper also presents an evaluation that shows that the individual cues from the two haptic metaphors can be discriminated, and that the combined feedback can be used to find combinations of features in data.},

	abstract = {In this work we study the position and velocity signal reconstructions using predictive coding when packets are lost during telemanipulation sessions and classify the high-level haptic artifacts perceived by the users. The usage of packet-switched networks for bilateral telemanipulation systems is challenging due to several adversities such as low transmission rates, packet delays, jitter and losses. The previously proposed deadband-based haptic data reduction approaches selectively decrease the high transmission rate of the force-feedback and position/velocity samples on account of human perception limitations. Recently, an error-resilient perceptual haptic data reduction approach was proposed to address the packet losses in the feedback channel. However, the impact of faltered transmission on the forward channel and its subjective influence on the user are still an open issue and thus are treated in this paper.},

	abstract = {The objective of this work is to demonstrate that progressive haptic guidance can accelerate and improve motor task training outcomes over visual or practice-only methods in a training virtual environment ({TVE).} To that end, we design haptic and visual guidance schemes based on detailed analyses of performance differences between experts and novice trainees performing a dynamic motor control task in a {TVE.} Research shows that {TVEs} that include haptic interfaces produce significant short-term performance gains over audio visual {TVEs.} However, improved or accelerated long-term training outcomes for dynamic tasks have yet to be demonstrated due, at least in part, to the increasing dependence of the trainee on the assistance. To avoid this dependence, a progressive guidance controller can gradually remove the assistance as the performance of the trainee improves. However, the inputs to the guidance controller must be based on measurements of performance in the necessary kinematic and dynamic components of the task. Prior work introduced two such quantitative performance measures. We implement similar measures, trajectory error and input frequency, to identify and classify performance levels, thereby providing valid and robust inputs to the guidance controller. We demonstrate that progressive haptic guidance schemes can improve training in a dynamic task.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a new subminiature impact type actuator which creates the haptic sensation in a mobile device. Recently, linear resonance actuators ({LRA)} are widely used. One of the key differences between an {LRA} and a traditional eccentric motor is that the {LRA} generates the vibrotactile sensation through resonance for minimizing response time. The strategy of operation near the resonant frequency, however, brought a new issue for creating vibrotactile sensation which can be strong enough to feel in arbitrary frequency. In order to achieve this issue, we adopt an unstable structure to amplify impact force and to reduce response rate. Due to the impact with fast rising and falling time in the proposed impact actuator, the available strong impact vibration is created over wide frequency range from {0Hz} to {100Hz.} The impact vibration generated from the proposed actuator is suitable for reproducing realistic button sensation and creating various vibration patterns in mobile devices.},

The algorithm uses a \&amp;\#8220;haptic equalizer\&amp;\#8221; and provides plausible sound-to-touch modality conversion based on human perceptual data. In addition, we present a user study carried out to evaluate the subjective performance (precision, harmony, fun, and preference) of the haptic music player, in comparison with the current practice of bass-band only vibrotactile playback via a single-frequency voice-coil actuator. The evaluation results indicated that the new dual-band playback outperforms the bass-only rendering, also providing several insights for further improvements. The developed system and experimental findings have implications for improving the multimedia experience with mobile devices.},

A methodology is presented integrating narrative analysis and iterative prototyping, based on gestural and performance data. Implementation of these theories should improve the efficiency and design of vocal augmentation in theatrical contexts; increasing generalizability, dramatic integration, and facilitating a more cohesive, contextualized performance.

The fingernail sensor uses photoplethysmography to measure the change in blood perfusion in the fingernail bed when the fingerpad touches a surface with various forces. The original fingernail sensor was rigidly attached to the human fingernail, necessitating a customized fabrication for each individual user. Using novel fabrication techniques, a new stretchable sensor has been developed, where optoelectronic components are embedded within a soft rubber substrate, connected by stretchable conductors. This stretchable sensor can conform to the two-dimensional curvature of any human finger, eliminating the need for individual customization. In this paper, we demonstrate the successful fabrication of a prototype sensor with two {LEDs} and two photodetectors.},

This framework, called space of possibilities ({SoP)}, is based on crossing the different constraints a player must face when playing his/her instrument. These constraints can be acoustical, biomechanical, and are considered along with the musicians' acquired skills. Such an approach can provide a unified ground for modelling performer–instrument relationships by encompassing different perspectives within a single view. We propose to define this {SoP} through the review of various computational techniques for expressive gestures: feature-based approaches, dynamic modelling, and segmental modelling. More precisely, we see how the notions of gesture invariance and variability, gesture qualities, and gesture primitives can help structure {SoP.}},

	abstract = {A series of experiments was conducted to evaluate how contact pressure and surface roughness influence the heat flux conducted out of the skin or object during contact. Changes in skin temperature assist in identifying objects held in the hand. In the first experiment an infrared thermal imaging system was used to measure skin temperature and contact area as participants generated forces ranging from 0.1 to 6 N with their index finger. The results showed that skin temperature decreased by an average of {5.5degC} across the range of forces studied and that the changes were greatest between 0.25-0.35 N and from 4-6 N. The second and third experiments examined the effect of the surface roughness of an object on skin temperature and on the perceived coldness of the object. A set of six copper blocks was machined to create a range of surface profiles. There was a slight decrease in skin temperature as the surface roughness of the object increased, contrary to theoretical predictions. Although small, these changes were perceptible as participants consistently chose the rougher of two stimuli when asked to select the cooler stimulus. These results indicate that contact pressure and surface roughness influence the change in skin temperature during contact and that they can have a perceptible influence on the perceived properties of objects held in the hand. Thermal models need to account for these effects if realistic feedback is to be presented in a thermal display.},

Participants had to complete three successive tasks: a dissimilarity task, a preference judgement task, and a resemblance (to push-buttons) judgement task. For the discrimination task, a {MultiDimensional} Scale analysis revealed: (1) a predominant role of frequency, (2) a role of duration for a given frequency, and (3) no role of waveform. An analysis of variance performed on the preference and resemblance data also point out the main role of the signal frequency. Finally, a correlation was found between preference and resemblance data, indicating that the participants tend to prefer signals judged to be similar to familiar tactile sensations.},

	abstract = {Abstract Research into music generation and into emulating human musical competence has attracted much attention in the field of computer science. In general, the results of academic research should be verified by assessing ‘objective effectiveness’, which is often represented by a ‘recognition ratio’. Although ‘objective effectiveness’ is also a requirement for research in music generation, it is meaningless unless subjective requisites are also satisfied. However, it is not easy for researchers to execute subjective evaluations within their individual endeavours. To address this difficulty within the research area of computer systems for generating expressive music performances, the Performance Rendering Contest (Rencon) was created. This is an international competition in which entrants present computer systems and the performances generated are graded, and has been held in conjunction with related international conferences. This paper presents an overview of Rencon history, highlighting the evaluative motivation of each contest. In addition, we discuss the possibilities of a new scientific research field in which future Rencons may play a role.},

	abstract = {Today, in production engineering we have already taken into usage complex virtual representations of the manufacturing environment were we can program, simulate, analyse and optimise key performances. Such systems are mainly working through keyboard/ mouse input while user feedback normally are direct visual through computer screen and text files. Such communication only relays on a limited spectre of our senses and the keyboard/mouse/screen systems cannot be said to be very human friendly, especially when the operator is expected to operate ldquoout of officerdquo in a unstructured, maybe dangerous or dirty, environment. In the near future we expect to see more advanced input/output devices like motion capturing and speech input systems while feedback will not be visual alone but include several other human senses. Combinatorial sensory information, interpreted by the human brain, becomes very handy when a stand alone sense is not enough to interpret the actual situation. Imitation of senses and feedback from virtual reality environments always meant a great problem. Realization of two (sight and hearing) out of the five human senses is indispensable. Simulation of these two senses is not complex issue; on the contrary the other three are quite challenging. This paper describes the development of a vibro-tactile glove which can provide sensory feedback from a virtual environment, either as a stand alone system but most important in combination with sight and audio feedback systems. Instead of implementing real force feedback, the focus is on tactile sensing, as an alternative way of achieving the same feedback. The glove contains six vibration motors on different locations on the hand. These locations include all five fingers, and the palm. Communication with the glove is wireless, enabling free movement for the user. The system is low cost and very small sized which allows for combining it with advanced input devices like a motion capturing suit.},

Using a model ({3D} finite element representation of fingertip skin, linear bi-phasic transduction function, and leaky-integrate-and-fire neuronal model), we systematically varied populations of tactile receptors in dimensions of density (100, 45, 20, and 10 sensors/cm2) and size (diameter 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, and 1.0 mm) to determine if a given modeled population can discriminate spheres and cylinders representative of objects used in activities of daily living. Using a scoring system which allows for direct comparisons between the populations, our results indicate that a population must have at least 20 sensors per cm2 to maintain response resolution in these activities of daily living and that larger-sized sensors do not degrade response resolution.},

Furthermore, they do not scale: studies show that users with large mp3 collections have abandoned the concept of playlists. To remedy the usability problems associated with playlist creation and navigation - in particular, reliance on visual feedback and the absence of rapid content scanning mechanisms - we propose a system that utilizes the haptic channel. A necessary first step in this objective is the creation of a haptic mapping for music. In this paper, we describe an exploratory study addressed at understanding the feasibility, with respect to learnability and usability, of efficient, eyes-free playlist navigation based on symbolic haptic renderings of key song parameters. Users were able to learn haptic mappings for music parameters to usable accuracy with 4 minutes of training. These results indicate promise for the approach and support for continued effort in both improving the rendering scheme and implementing the haptic playlist system.},

	abstract = {In cognitive science and philosophy, the conception of cognition has evolved rapidly in recent years. It is no longer strictly a process that happens inside the head, intervening between perception and action. Instead, cognition is considered something that subsumes both perception and action, engages the body, and even incorporates the response of objects in the environment to actions taken upon them. One speaks of cognition being embodied and extended. Cognitive processes such as problem solving might actually involve the coupled dynamics of the body and the environment, where the finding of problem solutions involves interactively driving the coupled dynamics toward behaviors that satisfy the task goals of an individual. Researchers in haptics have long been working with the notions of dynamical coupling between the body and environment, with interwoven definitions of perception and action, and with flexible conceptions of the proximal and distal and the physical and virtual. It is perhaps striking to suppose that the activity during which our users wield our interface devices might be considered cognition itself. We suggest in this paper that the field of haptics is uniquely positioned to draw upon and to contribute to active debates in cognitive science, and that a new interpretation of “interface” can be useful in launching such an endeavor.},

We bring together and discuss the previous computational approaches to rāga recognition correlating them with human techniques, in both Karṇāṭaka (south Indian) and Hindustānī (north Indian) music traditions. The approaches which are based on first-order pitch distributions are further evaluated on a large comprehensive dataset to understand their merits and limitations.

	abstract = {Aposematic insects use warning colours to deter predators, but many also produce odours or sounds when attacked by a predator. One possible role for these additional components is that they promote the association between the warning colour and the non-profitability it signals, thus reducing the chance of future attacks from visually hunting predators. This experiment explicitly tests this idea by looking at the effects of sound on a visual discrimination task. Young domestic chicks were trained to look for food rewards under coloured paper cones scattered in an experimental arena. In a subsequent visual discrimination task, they learned to discriminate between rewarded and non-rewarded hats on the basis of colour. Half the chicks performed this task in silence, whilst the other half had a tone played when they attacked non-rewarded hats. The presence of the tone improved the speed of colour discrimination learning. This demonstrates that there could be a selective advantage for aposematic coloured insects to emit sounds when attacked, since avian predators will learn to avoid their coloration more quickly. The role of psychological interactions between signal components in receivers is discussed in relation to the evolution of multimodal displays.},

Of particular interest is the match between the musician's mental focus on musical targets (the so-called musical intentions) and the expressive (or so-called auxiliary) body movements. To what extent are these related to each other? And what does this relationship reveal about mind–body connections? To approach these questions, a case study was set up around a clarinet solo performance played from score, covering a style of music unfamiliar to the player. The clarinetist's movements were recorded with an optical movement tracking system. A statistical analysis method was developed, to account for movement data in relation to the potential musical intentions and targets. The bottom-up movement analysis method was validated with the performer's annotations of targets in the musical score and the performer's annotations of communicative/sound facilitating gestures in the performance video. The results reveal that the mental focus on musical targets is related to bodily expression. This finding supports the idea of an embodied model of musical syntax processing, which is strongly related to corporeal gestures.},

The concepts are described in theory and examples are given of how they have been successfully applied. The cases make heavy use of different types of prototyping and this practice is also discussed. The development cases all relate to a single artifact, a gestural voice processing instrument called The Throat. This artifact has been in use since it was developed, and from that experience, three cases are presented. The focus of these cases is on how artistic vision through practice can recontextualize technology, and, without rebuilding it, redefine it and give it a new role to play.},

The results show that the vibration levels are well above threshold for almost all positions on the instruments in normal playing. It is concluded that the perceived vibrations may be of some assistance with regard to intonation in ensemble playing, in particular for the bass instruments. The finger forces exerted when playing the bowed strings, as well as the touch forces in piano playing were studied briefly. It was concluded that the kinesthetic forces perceived in playing may assist the timing in performance.},

The principal part is the realization of a high-quality haptic interaction of the car door for the manual operation. We implemented and tested four different impedance control schemes, of which impedance control with actuator force feedback performed best. This control scheme was subsequently used to haptically render different supportive dynamics and effects. An experimental evaluation with 16 participants revealed a predominant approval of the haptic sensation of the actuated car door.},

As the main conceptual contribution, we introduce a simple yet powerful paradigm that exploits the availability of different versions (recorded performances, score) of the same piece of music to stabilize and enrich the chord labelling process. As a result, we obtain a version-independent representation of the chord labelling results on a musically meaningful time axis given in bars. Furthermore, a visualization of this representation reveals consistencies and inconsistencies in the labelling results across different versions. Using this visualization for performing a detailed harmonic analysis of the Appassionata, it turns out that the consistencies typically correspond to harmonically stable passages and thus are of musical relevance. This shows that our visualization can be used as a supportive tool for exploring harmonic structures and constitutes a source of inspiration for musicologists.},

	abstract = {Psychological and neurophysiological studies have investigated the peripheral neural mechanisms implicated in tactile roughness perception. However, the cortical mechanisms involved in roughness processing are not well understood. In the present study, we used behavioural data and event-related evoked potentials ({ERPs)} to investigate the extent to which two tactile stimuli varying in roughness (triangular gratings peak-to-peak spacing of 1.6 mm and 2.8 mm) and movement (the time available for tactile contact with the surface) modulate early stages of brain activation. Behavioral results showed that participants discriminate the two levels of roughness at the three velocities explored in the study but they were judged as equivalent in pleasantness. The {ERP} results showed a biphasic early-fast N1-P2 deflection. The N1 and P2 peaks to the smoother texture occur earlier than that of the rougher texture. Considering velocity, the N1 onset occurs later for the slowest velocity, followed by the intermediate velocity and earlier for the fastest velocity and the three velocities differ significantly. {LORETA} analysis showed that N1 and P2 components of surface roughness are both related to the activation produced in the somatosensory cortex and posterior cingulated respectively, suggesting that these areas might be involved in the sensory processing of roughness.},

Most simulations only engage two of our five senses: sight and hearing. If we employ additional sensory communication channels in simulations, we may gain a deeper understanding of illustrated concepts by increasing the communication bandwidth and providing alternative perspectives. We implemented the sense of touch in {3D} simulations to teach important concepts in introductory physics. Specifically, we developed a visuo-haptic simulation for friction. We prove that interactive {3D} haptic simulations – if carefully developed and deployed – are useful in engaging students and allowing them to understand concepts faster. We hypothesize that large scale deployment of such haptic-based simulators in science laboratories is now possible due to the advancements in haptic software and hardware technology.},

In human subject trials, conducted with twenty participants using a prototype system, participants entered text significantly faster with tactile feedback than without (p = 0.02).

The students were separated into visual and visuohaptic groups to measure the possible benefits haptic feedback might provide as compared to the vision-alone condition. A 10-question content test was developed and administered before and after the learning activities. The pretest and posttest scores showed that all students benefited from the computer simulations. The visuohaptic group did not perform significantly better than the visual group. An important finding was that the fourth graders learned as much as the sixth graders, despite their younger age and little prior exposure to concepts such as density and volume, which are important for understanding buoyancy.

	abstract = {Molecular interactions typically have a high dynamic range ({HDR)}, combining short-range stiff repulsive effects with long-range, soft attractive and repulsive terms. As a result, faithful haptic rendering of such molecular interactions is both important and difficult, in particular in applications where the precise perception of molecular forces is necessary (e.g. in molecular docking simulations). Traditionally, teleoperation coupling using constant gain control schemes have limited applications since they are unable to transmit to users low attractive forces without truncating repulsive ones. Furthermore, constant scaling displacement induces either instability or time-consuming experiments (displacements are slow), which deteriorates the ease of manipulation. In this paper, we describe a variable gain haptic coupling method specifically designed to render high dynamic range (molecular) forces. The proposed method is evaluated by user tests on an experiment involving two water molecules. We observe that variable force amplification is widely appreciated, whereas variable displacement scaling is appropriated only for users familiar with haptic manipulation. A complex experiment on a {HIV} molecule is carried out using this variable gain system. Advantages and limitations of this approach are discussed.},

In this paper we introduce a novel method for satisfying high force update rates with deformable objects, yet retaining the visual quality of complex deformations and interactions. The objects that are haptically manipulated may have many degrees of freedom, but haptic interaction is often implemented in practice through low-dimensional force-feedback devices. We exploit the low-dimensional domain of the interaction for devising a novel linear approximation of interaction forces that can be efficiently evaluated at force-update rates. Moreover, our linearized force model is time-implicit, which implies that it accounts for contact constraints and the internal dynamics of deforming objects. In this paper we show examples of haptic interaction in complex situations such as large deformations, collision between deformable objects (with friction), or even self-collision.},

The present research aims at providing a ground for documentation policies that account for the creative process and provide relevant information for performance, migration, and analysis. To do so, we analyzed secondary ethnographic data from a two-year creation and production process of a musical work having a focus on gesture following. Using grounded theory, we developed a conceptual framework with different levels of abstraction and consequent levels of transferability to other creative contexts. Finally, we propose several paths for grounding a subsequent documentation framework in this conceptual framework.},

In particular, Performance measures are introduced which have so far not been pertinent in traditional robotics; these include, peak force, peak acceleration and frequency dependent measurements. Performance measures often quoted in traditional robotics are also discussed, however, the focus and relevance of these measures are different in haptic devices.

	abstract = {The active control of exploratory movements is an integral part of active touch. We investigated how the spatio-temporal extension of an exploration affects texture discrimination via active touch and how participants spontaneously control the extension of their exploration. Participants stroke one to 8 times across a virtual grating. Half of the participants judged the grating according to ridge amplitude, the other half judged ridge period. In both tasks just noticeable differences ({JNDs)} decreased with an increasing number of strokes, down to a (presumably) minimum {JND} for stroke numbers of about 6-7 or higher (according to a model fit). This extends previous findings on the perceptual effects of extended stimulation to the domain of active touch. Further, for spontaneous exploration, 6-7 strokes may be regarded as being optimal, given that this extension results in minimal {JNDs} while using the smallest number of strokes necessary. Many participants tended to spontaneously use clearly more than this optimal number of strokes, before they had experience with the task. With experience, stroke numbers were, however, individually closer to and, on average slightly below this number. That is, participants seem to have adapted their exploration to the task. This supports the view that the active control of exploratory movements can be used in order to optimize performance-when participants have sufficient experience with the haptic task.},

	abstract = {Abstract This paper presents a novel algorithmic approach to music performance analysis. Previous attempts to use algorithmic tools in this field focused typically on tempo and dynamics alone. We base our analysis on ten different performance categories (such as bowing, vibrato and durations). We adapt phylogenetic analysis tools to resolve the inherent inconsistencies between these categories, and describe the relationships between performances. Taking samples from 29 different performances of two pieces from Bach's sonatas for solo violin, we construct a ‘phylogenetic’ tree, representing the relationship between those performances. The tree supports several interesting relations previously conjectured by the musicology community, such as the importance of date of birth and recording period in determining interpretative style. Our work also highlights some unexpected inter-connections between performers, and challenges previous assumptions regarding the significance of educational background and affiliation to the historically informed performance ({HIP)} style.},

We had experiments and showed participants perceived angles of edges that was the same as the one they were visually touching, even though the angles of edges they were actually touching was different. These results prove that the perceived angles of edges could be modified if the difference of angles between edges is in the range of − 35° to 30°.},

Motion and force data flows in a teleoperation system are formulated in discrete time state-space models predicted by Bayesian filters, including the Kalman filter and particle filter. The particle filter, which is known as a robust tracking method in nonlinear and non-Gaussian environments, is used to compensate for the time-varying Internet delay. A stochastic analysis is presented to show stability improvement of a teleoperation system in the case when convergence of a Bayesian predictor is achieved and a generalized form of scattering transformation is used as a control scheme. Experiments are performed using a teleoperation system based on virtual reality. A haptic device is used as a human operator in conjunction with a mechanic-based virtual teleoperator by implementing the proposed Bayesian prediction method. Experimental results show that the proposed method improve stability of an overall teleoperation system in the presence of time-varying delay.},

	abstract = {Abstract We investigate a method for automatic extraction of inter-song similarity for songs selected from several genres of Western popular music. The specific purpose of this approach is to evaluate the predictive power of different feature extraction sets based on human perception of music similarity and to develop an algorithm able to reproduce and predict human ratings. The algorithm is a linear model that was trained and tested using perceptual data. We use publicly available algorithms to extract acoustic feature values from 78 songs used in a previous perceptual experiment. Feature value differences between songs are used in a multivariate linear regression calculation to find the optimal weighting coefficients for the feature values to best approximate the human similarity perception data. We use two evaluation methods: metrical and ordinal. We use a bootstrapping approach by randomly separating the experimental data into training and testing sets. We compare the performance of this model against the {G1C} model by Pampalk, winner of the {MIREX} 2006 competition on music similarity prediction. Both models produce a rather low performance on the metrical evaluation. However, on the ordinal evaluation, the linear regression model shows encouraging results (significantly outperforming the {G1C} algorithm): in the triadic comparison task, it can correctly predict 52.3 ± 0.5\% of the most similar pairs, while the estimated theoretical maximum, based on participant consistency on the most similar pair rankings is 78 ± 8\%. In a comparison of feature sets, we found the {MIR} toolbox to produce the best performance.},

	abstract = {In this work, a probabilistic model for multiple-instrument automatic music transcription is proposed. The model extends the shift-invariant probabilistic latent component analysis method, which is used for spectrogram factorization. Proposed extensions support the use of multiple spectral templates per pitch and per instrument source, as well as a time-varying pitch contribution for each source. Thus, this method can effectively be used for multiple-instrument automatic transcription. In addition, the shift-invariant aspect of the method can be exploited for detecting tuning changes and frequency modulations, as well as for visualizing pitch content. For note tracking and smoothing, pitch-wise hidden Markov models are used. For training, pitch templates from eight orchestral instruments were extracted, covering their complete note range. The transcription system was tested on multiple-instrument polyphonic recordings from the {RWC} database, a Disklavier data set, and the {MIREX} 2007 multi-F0 data set. Results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms leading approaches from the transcription literature, using several error metrics.},
