It includes various tasks, such as music classification, clustering, perception and cognition, etc. In this article, we report our recent perceptual studies on segmentation and genre classification, two indispensable steps in the {MIR} process. Segmentation attempts to capture ‘drastic’ changes in music and provides a basis for further perceptual and computational analysis while genre classification amounts to separating music into different groups such that each group uniformly represents a music genre. Our perceptual study considers various related issues. The goal of this work is to (1) explore and deepen our understanding of the relationship between perceptual surface and perceptual structure of music through segmentation by human subjects and (2)reveal and demonstrate the multi-label nature of genre classification.},

Does touch promote the construction of more connected and meaningful understandings?

A high quality video of a professional symphony orchestra was recorded high above the first rows of the audience area. The movement of the instrument bodies and the bow hands of the players were tracked with the video to resolve the time instants when the directions of the bow movements changed for individual players. The proposed tracking approach is evaluated extensively against several other methods. The temporal distributions of the bow direction changes were analysed from one longer and three shorter cases. The results indicate that one half of the bow strokes of a group of three players occur in an approximate 60 ms time-frame.},

To music is to take part in any capacity in a musical performance, and the meaning of musicking lies in the relationships that are established between the participants by the performance. Musicking is part of that iconic, gestural process of giving and receiving information about relationships which unites the living world, and it is in fact a ritual by means of which the participants not only learn about, but directly experience, their concepts of how they relate, and how they ought to relate, to other human beings and to the rest of the world. These ideal relationships are often extremely complex, too complex to be articulated in words, but they are articulated effortlessly by the musical performance, enabling the participants to explore, affirm and celebrate them. Musicking is thus as central in importance to our humanness as is taking part in speech acts, and all normally endowed human beings are born capable of taking part in it, not just of understanding the gestures but of making their own.},

In this experiment subjects were asked to discern a perfect steel ball bearing from a distorted one without visual cues. During the final discrimination task, subjects were given a pair of spheres coated in ink, staining their hands where they touched the ball bearings. Photographs were taken of the ink-stained hands and analyzed with a grid based on anatomical features. The sections of the hand most commonly used among all subjects were the thumb and the area between the index and middle finger. These regions had an average ink coverage of between 81 and 100 percent, much higher values than the rest of the hand.},

	abstract = {In a bilateral teleoperation system, conditions involving open-loop model parameters and controller parameters for ensuring teleoperator passivity are useful as control design guidelines to attain maximum teleoperation transparency (due to passivity/transparency tradeoffs). By teleoperator, we mean the teleoperation system excluding the human operator and the remote environment. The rationale behind considering teleoperator passivity instead of teleoperation system stability is that, unlike the former, the latter is influenced by the dynamics of the human operator and the remote environment, which are typically uncertain, time-varying, and/or nonlinear. In this paper, a condition for the passivity of a teleoperator is found when the teleoperation controllers are implemented in the discrete-time domain. Such as new passivity analysis is necessary because discretization causes energy leaks and does not necessarily preserve passivity. We show that the passivity criterion for the sampled-data teleoperator imposes a lower bound on the robot damping and upper bounds on the control gains and the sampling time. The criterion has been verified through computer simulations as well as experimental tests involving a bilateral teleoperation system consisting of a pair of Phantom Omni robots.},

	abstract = {Tactile thresholds and sensation magnitudes for single mechanical pulses of varying frequency and probe area were studied in order to provide psychophysical data for correlations of tactile sensations with functional properties of different types of human peripheral nerve fibers. Single mechanical pulses were delivered to the hairy or glabrous skin of the hand by means of a perspex probe (area 0.07, 0.7, 3.1, or 12.5 sq.-mm) fixed to the moving coil of an electromechanical vibrator. The frequency of the single pulse was 20, 60 or 150 Hz. Absolute and touch thresholds were measured with a method of production. Suprathreshold sensations were measured with the method of magnitude estimation (6 predetermined displacement amplitudes ranging from 50 to 950 μm). Both absolute and touch thresholds were significantly higher on the hairy than on the glabrous skin. The absolute thresholds varied between 44 and 140 μm on the hairy and between 9 and 45 μm on the glabrous skin; the touch threshold varied between 75 and 300 μm and 24 and 153 μm, respectively. Lower threshold values were obtained on both skin areas with increasing frequency of the pulse and probe area, the latter effect being significant only for the hairy skin. Standardized magnitude estimation functions could be described with power functions on both skin areas, the exponents of the functions varying between 0.70 and 1.41 on the hairy and between 0.55 and 0.86 on the glabrous skin. The equi-sensation contours showed the difference of sensitivity between the skin areas. Larger sensation magnitudes were obtained with increasing frequency of the pulse and probe area on both skin areas. These psychophysical findings indicate that there is a functional difference at absolute sensation thresholds between hairy and glabrous skin. This difference, however, disappears at higher sensation levels.},

	abstract = {Abstract This article presents a segmentation model applied to musician movements, taking into account different time structures. In particular we report on ancillary gestures that are not directly linked to sound production, whilst still being entirely part of the global instrumental gesture. Precisely, we study movements of the clarinet captured with an optical {3D} motion capture system, analysing ancillary movements assuming that they can be considered as a sequence of primitive actions regarded as base shapes. A stochastic model called the Segmental Hidden Markov Model is used. It allows for the representation of a continuous trajectory as a sequence of primitive temporal profiles taken from a given dictionary. We evaluate the model using two criteria: the Euclidean norm and the log-likelihood, then show that the size of the dictionary does not influence the fitting accuracy and propose a method for building a dictionary based on the log-likelihood criterion. Finally, we show that the sequence of primitive shapes can also be considered as a sequence of symbols enabling us to interpret the data as symbolic patterns and motifs. Based on this representation, we show that circular patterns occur in all players' performances. This symbolic step produces a different layer of interpretation, linked to a larger time scale, which might not be obvious from a direct signal representation.},

After this the focus moved to a smaller scale with the work of Adrian and Matthews; for instance, being largely on the mechanism of the nervous impulse and on biophysics rather than on the functioning of larger systems. Such were the successes of such an approach, with the accruing of Nobel Prizes for Adrian and Sherrington, Huxley and Hodgkin, and Katz, that whole system approaches only became in vogue once more within the {UK} in the latter decades of the last century.},

Pointing over time and with varying direction is often referred to as “scanning”, which is an emerging interaction technique and increasingly applied in the field of mobile navigation and orientation. Because there is no need to look at the screen while scanning, often haptic or audio feedback is used. In fact there exist several different scanning-based interaction concepts. However, until now it is impossible to analyse and compare these techniques systematically to identify the best concept for a certain scenario. In this paper we investigated how our own Tactile Compass scanning technique has been used in a field study. Based on our observations we identified a set of measures, which we propose to become a standard set for the analysis and comparison of scan-based interaction techniques. We further argue that our contribution may be beneficial for the creation of guidelines and support designers in selecting a proper scan-based interaction technique.},

A haptic interface is a feedback device that generates sensation to the skin and muscles, including a sense of touch, weight and rigidity. Compared to ordinary visual and auditory sensations, haptics is difficult to synthesise. Visual and auditory sensations are gathered by specialised organs, the eyes and ears. On the other hand, a sensation of force can occur at any part of the human body, and is therefore inseparable from actual physical contact. These characteristics lead to many difficulties when developing a haptic interface. Visual and auditory media are widely used in everyday life, although little application of haptic interface is used for information media.},

In this paper we present the results of three studies to inform the design of a wearable haptic feedback system for this application. The first study motivates our choice of feedback modality for each of the motions. The latter two studies explore how to present haptic feedback to train three different motions concurrently. When feedback is presented simultaneously, subjects have poor perception of three or more haptic cues, tend to focus on only one motion at a time, and require several steps to modify all three motions. These findings suggest that vibrational feedback should be presented one joint at a time for haptic gait retraining.},

It introduces a constraint-based path following approach with smooth node transition and intuitive branch selection during fine-scale exploration, as well as user-friendly camera control and visual aids for large-scale exploration. We demonstrate the successful application of these techniques to the analysis and understanding of dense neural networks.},

	abstract = {Several causes of instabilities in the interaction of users with actively controlled haptic devices, notably sampling effects, sensor quantization, and hardware nonlinearities, have been identified and analyzed in prior work. However, certain instabilities may occur that cannot be attributed to these hardware limitations. The problem becomes acute when rendering passive virtual environments which require compensation of the intrinsic device dynamics. We show that passivity, the standard robust stability criteria for haptic interface systems, cannot be maintained in certain circumstances due to Bode gain-phase integral constraints. In an experimental study, we demonstrate that some performance can be recovered by relaxing passivity requirements while maintaining coupled stability. To test stability, we identify frequency domain models of the user interaction, and check the Nyquist stability criterion rather than passivity.},

The first one concerned speculative (philosophical) and/or informal considerations made by practitioners and observers on the functioning of touch in early blind people, and more incidentally in cognitively impaired children. In the middle of the 19th century, studies on blindness led to the major invention by Louis Braille (1829 and 1837) of the raised-dot alphabet, universally used today, which allows early blind persons to have tactually access to written culture. The second trend is scientific and experimental. In the 19th century, this research concerned mainly the anatomy and physiology of somesthetic sensory receptors, neural pathways and cortical projections. Simultaneously, the methodological bases for experimental sciences were established.},

This position actually houses a number of distinct claims, some of which are more controversial than others. This paper distinguishes and evaluates the following six claims: (1) cognition is situated; (2) cognition is time-pressured; (3) we off-load cognitive work onto the environment; (4) the environment is part of the cognitive system; (5) cognition is for action; (6) offline cognition is body based. Of these, the first three and the fifth appear to be at least partially true, and their usefulness is best evaluated in terms of the range of their applicability. The fourth claim, I argue, is deeply problematic. The sixth claim has received the least attention in the literature on embodied cognition, but it may in fact be the best documented and most powerful of the six claims.},

Haptic data, which include position, velocity, and force data exchanged through the communication channel, are considered by various compression methods based on down-sampling. We introduce the operational rate-distortion performance measure that evaluates not only the compression ratio, but also the quality of reconstructed haptic data. The deadband method, also known as a perception-based haptic compression method, is categorized as an adaptive down-sampling method and compared with a fixed rate down-sampling method. In the case of force data compression, we propose the modified deadband method, which adopts a force predictor, a quantizer, and a contact force detector. Experiments are performed by using a haptic device incorporated with a virtual teleoperator. The performance evaluation and comparison of the fixed rate down-sampling, deadband, prediction-based deadband, and modified deadband methods are provided. The results show that the proposed method achieves improvement in the compression ratio and quality measurement compared to other methods.},

Little is known about how students with visual impairments access and interpret these types of visually-dependent instructional materials. This study explored the efficacy of new haptic (simulated tactile feedback and kinesthetics) instructional technology for teaching cell morphology and function to middle and high school students with visual impairments. The study examined students' prior experiences learning about the cell and cell functions in classroom instruction, as well as how haptic feedback technology impacted students' awareness of the 3-D nature of an animal cell, the morphology and function of cell organelles, and students' interest in the haptic technology as an instructional tool. Twenty-one students with visual impairment participated in the study. Students explored a tactile model of the cell with a haptic point probe that allowed them to feel the cell and its organelles. Results showed that students made significant gains in their ability to identify cell organelles and found the technology to be highly interesting as an instructional tool. The need for additional adaptive technology for students with visual impairments is discussed.},

Several studies have reported that haptic feedback improves performance in collaborative tasks. However, few researches have tried to evaluate the influence of haptic feedback on mutual awareness, and to link the corresponding measures with the performance and efficiency factors. In the context of collaborative {3D} polygonal modelling, we present a collaborative interaction method that dynamically adjust the selection area of the different involved partners. The aim of this interaction method is to improve the efficiency of collaborative working by improving the partners’ mutual awareness. The experimental evaluation compares the proposed collaborative method of selection with a standard and individual method of selection used in most polygonal modelling software. The experimental results show an improvement in working efficiency and a better work distribution between the partners. Moreover, the analysis of awareness measure shows that the proposed approach balances self awareness and mutual awareness.},

This also includes the usage of typical human senses like vision, hearing and tactile sensing. Second, a robot manipulating items in an unstructured environment like a person’s home needs to have some haptic feedback: information whether an item is firmly grasped or sliding is important for handling objects. Third, different kinds of haptic and tactile feedback are required for moving and acting in a human-built environment: collision detection just as well as haptic feedback for actions or control by a human operator.},

	abstract = {Human-machine collaborative teleoperation systems were introduced to overcome limitations of state-of-the-art teleoperation systems by using a virtual assistant that supports the human operator in the execution of a task. Since assistances are highly task-dependent a correct classification of the currently performed task is paramount. In this paper, we present a novel approach for improving task classification for a human-machine collaborative teleoperation system. Starting from a classical {HMM-based} classifier implemented in our previous research, we introduce a method for correcting erroneous task classifications by evaluating an agreement criterion. This criterion is based on interactive forces and is used to distinguish between situations in which human and assistant agree/disagree in their execution of the task. Using disagreement as indicator for the activation of an unsuitable/suboptimal assistance, erroneous task classifications are identified and the original classification result is revised. The proposed approach shows significant improvements in task classification coming along with a comparable low implementation effort.},

However, auditory sound localization is based on the utilization of both intensive-difference and temporal-difference cues while cutaneous sound localization is based almost entirely on the utilization of only intensive-difference cues. Furthermore, the time interval necessary for resolving two temporally separated pulses was found to be 2.0 ms for binaural and monaural stimulation and, at best, 10 ms for stimulation of the skin. The superior temporal acuity of the ears over the skin was again demonstrated by the finding that pairs of auditory pulses separated by less than 30 ms were perceived as more separated in time than pairs of cutaneous stimuli separated by the same time interval. A series of experiments was conducted to measure inhibitory interaction between touch and hearing. When absolute thresholds were measured by a tracking method in which the subject was free to vary his judgment criterion, auditory stimulation by a click was found to increase tactile thresholds for mechanical pulses by as much as 5.0 {dB.} Intense tactile pulses slightly increased the auditory click threshold. Subsequent experiments using signal-detection methodology revealed that auditory-tactile masking is caused by a slight reduction in stimulus detectability accompanied by a corresponding increase in the subject's criterion.},

	abstract = {In the context of music retrieval, the query-by-example paradigm has attracted a large amount of attention: given a query in the form of a music excerpt, the task is to automatically retrieve all excerpts from the database containing parts or aspects which are somehow similar to the query. This problem is particularly difficult for digital waveform-based audio data such as {CD} recordings. Because of the complexity of such data, the notion of similarity used to compare different audio clips is a delicate issue and largely depends on the respective application as well as on the user requirements. In this chapter, we consider the problem of audio matching. Here the goal is to retrieve all audio clips from the database that in some sense represent the same musical content as the query clip. This is typically the case when the same piece of music is available in several interpretations and arrangements. For example, given a 20-s excerpt of Bernstein’s interpretation of the theme of Beethoven’s Fifth Symphony, the goal is to find all other corresponding audio clips in the database; this includes the repetition in the exposition or in the recapitulation within the same interpretation as well as the corresponding excerpts in all recordings of the same piece conducted, e.g., by Karajan or Sawallisch. Even more challenging is to also include arrangements such as Liszt’s piano transcription of Beethoven’s Fifth or a synthesized version of a corresponding {MIDI} file. Obviously, the degree of difficulty increases with the degree of variations one wants to permit in the audio matching.},

This paper presents the design and control of a modular 3-finger haptic device that can be used to interact with virtual scenarios or to teleoperate dexterous remote hands. In a modular haptic device, each module allows the interaction with a scenario by using a single finger; hence, multi-finger interaction can be achieved by adding more modules. Control requirements for a multifinger haptic device are analyzed and new hardware/software architecture for these kinds of devices is proposed. The software architecture described in this paper is distributed and the different modules communicate to allow the remote manipulation. Moreover, an application in which this haptic device is used to interact with a virtual scenario is shown.},

Overall identification rate for thermal icons was 64.6\%, but identification of individual parameters was promising, at 94\% accuracy for direction of thermal change (warming/cooling) and 73.1\% accuracy for subjective intensity (moderate/strong). Results showed that walking outdoors did not significantly worsen icon identification compared to sitting outdoors, but the environmental temperature had a strong influence. Recommendations are given on how better to design and adapt thermal feedback for use in outdoor mobile scenarios.},

Results indicated that an easy search was performed with a parallel strategy, while in a more difficult search a serial movement strategy is used. Short, fluent movements were made in the easy search, whereas the difficult search showed more detailed movements and this amount increased when more items were to be searched. These differences between the search tasks remained when corrected for travelled distance, while path length could partly explain dissimilarities between trials with a target present and absent. Overall, these results indicate that movement strategies are adjusted primarily to the search condition and the salience of the target, and less to the presence of a target and set size.},

Though a listener may perceive a movement from the first tone to the second, each tone merely begins and ends at its stationary position on the frequency continuum. Recent advances in the modeling of apparent- motion effects in vision provide a starting point for the modeling of the strong apparent- motion effects in music. An adaptation of the Grossberg- Rudd model of apparent motion in vision, when given input representing the strengths of pitch sensations positioned along a one- dimensional frequency continuum, can simulate important musical phenomena of auditory stream segregation, van Noorden's melodic- fission/ temporal- coherence boundaries, various Gestalt effects, aspects of dynamic attending, and Narmour's predicted categorical distinction between musical intervals implying a continuation and those implying a reversal of direction.},

Then, in Sect. 9.3, we formally introduce the concept of kinematic chains, which are generally used to model flexibly linked rigid bodies such as robot arms or human skeletons. Kinematic chains are parameterized by joint angles, which in turn can be represented in various ways. In Sect. 9.4, we describe and compare three important angle representations based on rotation matrices, Euler angles, and quaternions. Each of these representations has its strengths and weaknesses depending on the respective analysis or synthesis application.},

The developed system consists of a video-based motion-tracking system, with a camera hanging in the ceiling above the stage. The performer's motion and position on stage is used to control the playback of sonic fragments from a database of violin sounds, using concatenative synthesis as the sound engine. The setup allows the performer to improvise freely together with the electronic sounds being played back as she moves around the “sonic space.” The system has been stable in rehearsal and performance, and the simplicity of the approach has been inspiring to both the performer and the audience.},

A key functionality of this technology is altering the haptic properties of real objects by means of virtual haptic feedback. Previously, we have developed a haptic augmentation system in which object stiffness was modulated. In this paper, we extend our framework to cover further haptic properties: friction and weight. Simple but effective algorithms for estimating and altering these properties have been developed. The first approach allows us to change the inherent friction between a tool tip and a surface to a desired one identified in an offline process. The second technique enables a user to perceive an altered weight when lifting an object at two interaction points. The performance of the proposed algorithms has been evaluated on real objects. The errors remain within reasonable bounds and compare well to the relevant perceptual Weber fractions. Limitations of our technique are identified, and possible extensions are proposed.},

	abstract = {Audiovisual communications is at the core of multimedia systems that allow users to interact across distances. It is common understanding that both audio and video are required for high-quality interaction. While audiovisual information provides a user with a satisfactory impression of being present in a remote environment, physical interaction and manipulation is not supported. True immersion into a distant environment and efficient distributed collaboration require the ability to physically interact with remote objects and to literally get in touch with other people. Touching and manipulating objects remotely becomes possible if we augment traditional audiovisual communications by the haptic modality. Haptic communications is a relatively young field of research that has the potential to substantially improve human-human and human-machine interaction. In this paper, we discuss the state-of-the-art in haptic communications both from psychophysical and technical points of view. From a human perception point of view, we mainly focus on the multimodal integration of video and haptics and the improved performance that can be achieved when combining them. We also discuss how the human adapts to discrepancies and synchronization errors between different modalities, a research area which is typically referred to as perceptual learning. From a technical perspective, we address perceptual coding of haptic information and the transmission of haptic data streams over resource-constrained and potentially lossy networks in the presence of unpredictable and time-varying communication delays. In this context, we also discuss the need for objective quality metrics for haptic communication. Throughout the paper, we stress the fact that haptic communications is not meant as a replacement of traditional audiovisual communications but rather as an additional dimension for telepresence that will allow us to advance in our quest for truly immersive communication.},

	abstract = {In telepresence and teleaction systems the haptic communication channel plays a central role. As it closes a global control loop any introduced communication delay possibly destabilizes the system and impairs the performance. The scattering theory is known to solve these stability issues by transmitting wave variables instead of haptic signals, i.e. force and velocity, over the communication channel. For stability and performance additionally high packet rates are required stressing the underlying network resources. Perceptual coding techniques of haptic signals, such as the Weber-inspired deadband approach, are known to successfully reduce the packet rate on the haptic channel. However, as wave variables do not directly represent haptic information but a linear transformation of both signals, perceptual coding is not directly applicable anymore. In this paper, we present a novel control scheme as well as a modification of the deadband approach to take advantage of the stabilization ability of the wave variables while allowing perceptual coding on the communication channel. Simulation results and comparison with the wave variables architecture indicate improved data compression for same degree of transparency for purely stiff as well as free environments.},

	abstract = {Abstract For many people, live concerts occupy an important position in their experience of music. The interaction between audience and performers creates a special tension, which also influences the performing musicians. This paper presents a method to study how the presence of an audience influences performers. To study this influence, a concert with a singer and a viola da gamba player was recorded using audio, video and acceleration sensors (invisibly) attached to wrists and back of the performers. These data were compared to the general rehearsal, recorded in identical settings. This enabled a scientifically valid comparison, without challenging ecological validity. General rehearsal and concert performances were relatively similar, which shows that performers are able to reproduce their interpretation. However, comparison between conditions revealed some interesting differences. Tempo analysis showed that the pieces in a slower, more flexible tempo were performed slower in concert, while the faster, more dance-like tempi were performed slightly faster. Gesture analysis suggested a tendency for the singer to use more open, communicative postures during the concert, to change posture more often and take more time in the transitions. The movement analysis showed an overall increase in intensity of the hand movements of the singer. In summary, we may conclude that the different methods of analysis demonstrated an intensification of the performance while interacting with the audience.},

	abstract = {A motor theory of speech perception, initially proposed to account for results of early experiments with synthetic speech, is now extensively revised to accommodate recent findings, and to relate the assumptions of the theory to those that might be made about other perceptual modes. According to the revised theory, phonetic information is perceived in a biologically distinct system, a ‘module’ specialized to detect the intended gestures of the speaker that are the basis for phonetic categories. Built into the structure of this module is the unique but lawful relationship between the gestures and the acoustic patterns in which they are variously overlapped. In consequence, the module causes perception of phonetic structure without translation from preliminary auditory impressions. Thus, it is comparable to such other modules as the one that enables an animal to localize sound. Peculiar to the phonetic module are the relation between perception and production it incorporates and the fact that it must compete with other modules for the same stimulus variations.},

Employing an iterative warping and averaging strategy, we then describe an efficient algorithm that automatically derives a motion template from a class of training motions. We summarize the main ideas of this algorithm in Sect. 13.2 before giving the technical details in Sect. 13.3. In Sect. 13.4, we report on our experiments on template learning and discuss a number of illustrative examples to demonstrate the descriptive power of motion templates. Finally, in Sect. 13.5, we close with some general remarks on the multiple alignment problem underlying our learning procedure. In this and the following chapter, we close follow Müller and Röder [143]. An accompanying video is available at [144].},

Through iterative design, prototyping, programming, and testing, each of these servo-motor-based mechanisms produces a signal that is gradable in magnitude, can be played in a variety of temporal patterns, is localizable to a small area of skin, and, for three of the four actuators, has an associated direction. Additionally, we have tried to design toward many of the characteristics that have made high frequency vibration the most common form of wearable tactile feedback, including low cost, light weight, comfort, and small size. Bolstered by largely positive comments from naive users during an informal testing session, we plan to continue improving these devices for future use in tactile motion guidance.},

In vision, spatial constancy refers to the conversion of retinotopic signals into spatiotopic representations, allowing the observer to perceive space independently of his or her own eye movements, or at least partly so. The problem would seem at least as important in haptic perception, where sensory surfaces undergo even more complex movements in space. Here we develop a methodology for studying haptic spatial constancy, which involves a tactile display mounted on a mobile platform, and which allows us to decouple movements of the sensory surface - in this case the fingertip - from movements of objects on the fingertip. Using this apparatus, we find evidence for only weak haptic spatial constancy.},

	abstract = {Enclosing objects in the hand is a common and efficient way of haptic exploration. Recently, the importance of grasping for more realistic haptic perception of virtual objects has been recognised in haptic interface design. While several studies on haptic perception have addressed haptic exploration of a single object, perception of several objects grasped together in the hand has received almost no attention yet. In this study we focus on the importance of freedom to manipulate the objects in the hand for three-dimensional shape perception. Furthermore, we investigate differences in detection speed for different positions in the grasping hand. Subjects were asked to search for a cube among spheres or for a sphere among cubes. Response times were measured for different locations of target shape in the hand. Also, the way in which the items were fixed was varied from allowing small displacements and rotation of the shapes to rigidly fixed. There were only differences in search times between the different positions in the hand, when the centre item was difficult to access because of the surrounding items. Finally, we show that search was faster when the items were rigidly fixed than when displacement and rotation was possible. This shows that more exploratory freedom does not necessarily make search for a three-dimensional shape faster.},

	abstract = {This paper explores how tactile feedback can support cyclist in order to fulfill user-defined training programs. Therefore, actuators are integrated in cyclists’ shoes. The rhythm the cyclist should pedal is communicated via tactile feedback so that the heart rate is kept in an interval which is, for example, optimal for increasing stamina. After a preliminary study, which was used to gather the optimal position for the actuators on feet, a working prototype of such a system was developed. This prototype was tested in a preliminary study by two participants in the wild. They were able to understand the communicated tactile feedback, enjoyed using our system and stated that they could imagine using such a system regularly. This indicates that communicating tactile feedback via the user’s feet is another application domain where vibration signals can be of high benefit and can be used to communicate information to the user as audio or visual information are not appropriate.},

The interface was evaluated using a target-finding task to explore how auditory feedback can be used in isolation or combined with haptic feedback for navigation. Twenty-three users were asked to locate targets using auditory feedback in the virtual structure across both horizontal and vertical orientations of the planes, with and without haptic feedback. Findings from the evaluation experiment reveal that users performed the task faster in the bi-modal conditions (with combined auditory and haptic feedback) with a horizontal orientation of the virtual planes.},

With vision and audition, the list of such known cues is quite extensive [2, 3]. For example, visual depth perception in humans is thought to rely on monocular, oculomotor and binocular cues. Monocular depth cues include motion parallax, color contrast, perspective, relative size, relative height, focus, occlusion, shading, texture gradient, shadows, interreflections, and others. Oculomotor cues include accommodation and convergence. Binocular cues include disparity-based stereopsis. Such collections have been also identified for other object qualities such as size or color. With audition, say for object localization, there are analogous notions, such as interaural time difference, interaural intensity differences, or spectral cues related to head-related transfer functions, in addition to monaural cues [4].},

To reduce the duty of the device motion, the weighting function in the algorithm is improved. Control panel surface coordinates are newly introduced in the motion planning so that unintended collisions of the device with the user are completely avoided in free space.

The haptic interface, which consists of a robot arm and hand, can be used in a large workspace and can provide multipoint contact between the user and a virtual environment. However, the following problems peculiar to a multi-{DOF} robot have resulted: a backlash, a large amount of friction, many motors, and many sensors. In order to solve these problems, a new mechanism and a wire-saving control system have been designed and developed. Furthermore, experiments in both free space and constraint space have been carried out. In comparison with the previous {HIRO}, the force errors in free space and in constraint space have been reduced to 30\% and 57\%, respectively. These results show a high-precision force representation and the great potential of {HIRO} {III.}},

	abstract = {We have developed two different magnetic levitation devices which provide unprecedented ranges of motion in both translation and rotation to a levitated handle to be used for tool-based haptic interaction. The first device levitates a handle attached to a thin spherical shell of flat coils suspended in permanent magnet fields using Lorentz forces. A novel coil type and magnet configuration provides motion ranges of 50 mm and 60 degrees in all directions, double the translation and triple the rotation ranges of the current maximum range Lorentz levitation haptic devices developed at Carnegie Mellon University. The second device uses a planar array of cylindrical coils to levitate a platform of one or more magnets. By using redundant control methods and an experimentally measured high resolution model of the forces and torques generated on the levitated magnets from each coil, the translation range of the magnet in horizontal directions and its rotation in all directions and can be extended potentially indefinitely. The present prototype uses 10 coils to levitate a single magnet over a 80times60 mm planar range, a 30 mm vertical range, and a tilt range of 40 degrees, or to control the yaw rotation of a pair of magnets over 360 degrees. Design and control methods are presented with preliminary motion trajectory results from both devices.},

Subjects were asked to visit the environment wearing an head-mounted display and a custom made pair of sandals enhanced with sensors and actuators. A 12-channels surround sound system delivered a soundscape which was consistent with the visual environment. In the first experiment, passive haptics was provided by having a physical wooden platform present in the laboratory. In the second experiment, no passive haptics was present. In both experiments, subjects reported of having a more realistic experience while auditory and haptic feedback are present. However, measured physiological data and post-experimental presence questionnaire do not show significant differences when audio-haptic feedback is provided.},

	abstract = {In the context of music retrieval, the query-by-example paradigm has attracted a large amount of attention: given a query in the form of a music excerpt, the task is to automatically retrieve all excerpts from the database containing parts or aspects which are somehow similar to the query. This problem is particularly difficult for digital waveform-based audio data such as {CD} recordings. Because of the complexity of such data, the notion of similarity used to compare different audio clips is a delicate issue and largely depends on the respective application as well as on the user requirements. In this chapter, we consider the problem of audio matching. Here the goal is to retrieve all audio clips from the database that in some sense represent the same musical content as the query clip. This is typically the case when the same piece of music is available in several interpretations and arrangements. For example, given a 20-s excerpt of Bernstein’s interpretation of the theme of Beethoven’s Fifth Symphony, the goal is to find all other corresponding audio clips in the database; this includes the repetition in the exposition or in the recapitulation within the same interpretation as well as the corresponding excerpts in all recordings of the same piece conducted, e.g., by Karajan or Sawallisch. Even more challenging is to also include arrangements such as Liszt’s piano transcription of Beethoven’s Fifth or a synthesized version of a corresponding {MIDI} file. Obviously, the degree of difficulty increases with the degree of variations one wants to permit in the audio matching.},

At the first level, motion features are compared in the spatial context of the current video frame; at the intermediate level, salient behavior is analyzed on a short temporal context; at the third level, computation of saliency is extended to longer time windows. An attention/saliency index is computed at the three levels based on an information theory approach. This model can be considered as a preliminary step towards context-aware expressive gesture analysis.},

First one must understand which afferent type(s) and cortical pathways are involved in the aspect of perception that you want to understand. Then one must understand how information is represented and coded in the neural responses. The earliest attempts at addressing the neural pathways underlying perception relied on lesion studies in which animals were trained to perform specific behavioral tasks and then were retested following the ablations. If the animal could not perform the task then the area that was ablated was deemed essential for the behavior. More recently researchers use functional imaging techniques to address these questions. Understanding the neural codes underlying behavior has been elusive. The intellectual breakthrough came from studies that combined psychophysical studies in humans with neurophysiological studies in monkeys [1, 2].},

	abstract = {Touch-free gesture technology is beginning to become more popular with consumers and may have a significant future impact on interfaces for digital photography. However, almost every commercial software framework for gesture and pose detection is aimed at either desktop {PCs} or high-powered {GPUs}, making mobile implementations for gesture recognition an attractive area for research and development. In this paper we present an algorithm for hand skeleton tracking and gesture recognition that runs on an {ARM-based} platform (Pandaboard {ES}, {OMAP} 4460 architecture). The algorithm uses self-organizing maps to fit a given topology (skeleton) into a {3D} point cloud. This is a novel way of approaching the problem of pose recognition as it does not employ complex optimization techniques or data-based learning. After an initial background segmentation step, the algorithm is ran in parallel with heuristics, which detect and correct artifacts arising from insufficient or erroneous input data. We then optimize the algorithm for the {ARM} platform using fixed-point computation and the {NEON} {SIMD} architecture the {OMAP4460} provides. We tested the algorithm with two different depth-sensing devices (Microsoft Kinect, {PMD} Camboard). For both input devices we were able to accurately track the skeleton at the native framerate of the cameras.},

To counter these issues, efficient perceptually motivated packet-rate reduction schemes have been developed. These schemes are conventionally evaluated for perceived quality via subjective user tests. Such tests are time-consuming, expensive and require precise control of experimental conditions. Computer modeling of telepresence sessions can, on the other hand, bring repeatability, ease of observation, definite control over system parameters and task description and fairness of comparison. In this paper, we present first steps towards a methodology and a framework to model and simulate a networked haptic interaction and evaluate it objectively for the quality of experience. Towards this purpose, we model the human control action and haptic perception process in teleoperation. Our results show that simulations of these models for a range of data reduction scheme parameters produce quality estimates whose trend is comparable to carefully performed subjective user tests.},

Experiment 1 used a match-to-sample task, in which blindfolded subjects were directed to match objects on a particular dimension (e.g., texture). Hand movements during object exploration were reliably classified as “exploratory procedures,” each procedure defined by its invariant and typical properties. The movement profile, i.e., the distribution of exploratory procedures, was directly related to the desired object knowledge that was required for the match. Experiment 2 addressed the reasons for the specific links between exploratory procedures and knowledge goals. Hand movements were constrained, and performance on various matching tasks was assessed. The procedures were considered in terms of their necessity, sufficiency, and optimality of performance for each task. The results establish that in free exploration, a procedure is generally used to acquire information about an object property, not because it is merely sufficient, but because it is optimal or even necessary. Hand movements can serve as “windows,” through which it is possible to learn about the underlying representation of objects in memory and the processes by which such representations are derived and utilized.},

	abstract = {It has been known for a long time in the automobile industry that the first contact between the customer and a car in the showroom consists of opening the door, sitting in the car and closing the door. Therefore, the sounds of the door opening and closing are carefully designed to invoke feelings of high quality and safety in the customer. Of course, the vehicle’s operating noises are equally crucial to the perception of overall quality. The operating noises of household appliances have gained increasing importance because these noises can negatively or positively influence our daily life. When shopping, customers consider the sound power level of the household appliance provided by the manufacturers. In most cases, it is not possible to listen to the machine in operation. However, a common practice of customers is to knock the sidewalls or open and close the doors of the machine. The knocking sound carries information about the quality and solidity of the product and its material properties. The perception of the knocking sound is normally coupled to a tactile/kinesthetic impression of the knocking event. The aims of this study are to identify the perceptually important features of the knocking sound that affect the impression of quality, define the guidelines for a target sound, make suggestions regarding structural modifications to realize the target sound, and investigate the interaction between auditory and haptic stimuli in the overall product-quality assessment. To achieve these aims, experiments with unimodal and multimodal stimulus presentations were conducted. The results showed that an optimal knocking sound is dull, moderately loud, atonal, and has no distinctive long-lasting frequency components, particularly at high frequencies. A quality index was proposed based on psychoacoustic metrics. The physical coupling between the sound and the vibrations causes that both sensory cues have similar effects on perceived quality.},

Correlations of unit activity with sensations elicited by tactile pulses (single cycle sinusoids of 20, 60 and 150 Hz) were examined with simultaneous measurements of unit activity and sensation thresholds and magnitude. A total of 264 mechanoreceptive units were identified. Of all units 66\% were classified as slowly adapting ({SA)} and 34\% as rapidly adapting ({RA)} units. Mechanical thresholds of the units as well as simultaneously measured sensation thresholds decreased with increasing frequency of the pulse. The thresholds of several {SA} units were identical with the subjective thresholds. The responses of the units to supraliminal pulses consisted maximally of 7 impulses. Most {SAI} and {RA} units were able to code to some extent the stimulus amplitude on the basis of number of impulses, but only {RA} units had stimulus-response functions indicating velocity coding. Comparisons of the estimates of sensation magnitude with the number of impulses in the response indicated that the estimate may be based mainly on activity in a population of {RA} units. The comparison of the present results with earlier reports on properties of receptors in the glabrous skin of the human hand indicates that there are some differences between the characteristics of receptors in the hairy and glabrous skin. However, human receptors in the hairy skin do not seem to differ from the corresponding receptors in the animals.},

	abstract = {Even though there is a rapidly growing corpus of motion capture data, there still is a lack of efficient motion retrieval systems that allow to identify and extract user-specified motions. Previous retrieval systems often require manually generated textual annotations, which roughly describe the motions in words. Since the manual generation of reliable and descriptive labels is infeasible for large datasets, one needs efficient content-based retrieval methods that only access the raw data itself. In this context, the query-by-example ({QBE)} paradigm has attracted a large amount of attention: given a query in form of a motion fragment, the task is to automatically retrieve all motion clips from the database containing parts or aspects similar to the query. The crucial point in such an approach is the notion of similarity used to compare the query with the database motions. For the motion scenario, two motions may be regarded as similar if they represent variations of the same action or sequence of actions. These variations may concern the spatial as well as the temporal domain. For example, the two jumps shown in Fig. 11.1 describe the same kind of motion, even though they differ considerably with respect to timing, intensity, and execution style (note, e.g., the arm swing). Similarly, the kicks shown in Fig. 1.1 describe the same kind of motion, even though they differ considerably with respect to direction and height of the kick. In other words, semantically similar motions need not be numerically similar, as is also pointed out in [107].},

This study investigated the contribution of ancillary body movements on the perception of musical performances. Using kinematic displays of four clarinetists, perceptual experiments were conducted in which participants were asked to rate specific music-related dimensions of the performance and the performer. Additionally, motions of particular body parts, such as movements of the arms and torso, as well as motion amplitudes of the whole body were manipulated in the kinematic display. It was found that manipulations of arm and torso movements have fewer effects on the observers' ratings of the musicians than manipulations concerning the movement of the whole body. The results suggest that the multimodal experience of musicians is less dependent on the players' particular body motion behaviors than it is on the players' overall relative motion characteristics.},

Tactile information from the fingertips has been shown to contribute to the control of timing in finger tapping tasks. We addressed the hypothesis that reduction of timing errors is related to tactile afferent information in pianists’ finger movements during performance. Twelve pianists performed melodies at four rates in a synchronization-continuation paradigm. The pianists’ finger motion trajectories toward the piano keys, recorded with a motion capture system, contained different types and amounts of kinematic landmarks at different performance rates. One landmark, a finger–key ({FK)} landmark, can occur when the finger makes initial contact with the key surface and changes its acceleration abruptly. Overall, there were more {FK} landmarks in the pianists’ keystrokes, as the performance rate increased. The pianists were divided into two groups: those with low percentages of {FK} in the medium rates that increased with increasing performance rate and those with persistently high {FK} percentages. Low-{FK} pianists showed a positive relationship between increased tactile feedback from the current keystroke and increased temporal accuracy in the upcoming keystroke. These findings suggest that sensory information available at finger–key contact enhances the timing accuracy of finger movements in piano performance.},

The sensation level difference due to the different frequencies that result when using vibrating motors on the right and left fingers causes a phantom sensation that is perceived as if the stimuli were between the fingers. The change of sensation level difference between both hands due to the frequency modulation creates a somatosensory illusion using this phantom sensation, which occurs in such a way as to feel like a vibration flow from one hand to the other hand. We conducted experiments to evaluate whether the tactile flow and the phantom sensation can be perceived. Participants reported sensing the vibrotactile flow and the phantom sensation.},

	abstract = {Palpation is important in both veterinary and medical health professions. It is however difficult to learn, teach and assess. More must be understood about the skills involved in palpation. The present study compares the ability of practicing veterinarians and veterinary students to identify stiffness values. An absolute identification paradigm was used where a force-feedback device rendered virtual surfaces with 5 levels of stiffness within a ldquoclinically relevantrdquo range of 0.2 - 0.5 N/mm. The results from 12 veterinarians and 14 veterinary students show that the veterinarians performed significantly better than the students (p Lt 0.001). The mean information transfer was 0.97 bits (almost 2 perfectly-identifiable stiffness levels) for the veterinarians and 0.58 bits (1 correctly-identified stiffness level) for the students. However, neither group was able to reliably identify more than 2 levels of stiffness, indicating that the success of veterinarians in clinical practice probably relies on additional properties such as size, shape and texture. Our findings suggest that stiffness perception in the context of veterinary medicine is a learned clinical skill. Quantifying expert ability will help inform teaching methods and set targets for students. Similar psychophysical methods can also be used to monitor student performance throughout the learning process. Future work will examine the contributions of other object properties as well as motor strategies to palpation performance.},

Many mechanical conflicts arise when trying to put to work together two or more conventional haptic devices. Due to collisions and other incompatibilities the resulting workspace when using these configurations is usually too small, making this a non-viable option. Therefore, a new multi-finger haptic device called {MasterFinger} 3 is developed to meet the demands of freedom of movement within a wide workspace. The aim of the new haptic device presented in this paper is to allow an intuitive human-machine interaction in a natural fashion. This interaction permits the end-user to control and operate an advanced robotic hand precisely. In order to reach this purpose, the attitude of at least three fingers should be measured. Moreover, the attitude of the other two fingers can be deduced from those measurements. Consequently, the mechanical design and the electronic architecture are described in detail in the following sections.},

A person without vision or hearing may use a method called Tadoma, placing his or her hands over the face and neck of a speaker to understand speech [1].

Discrete and continuous deformation gestures were used in each case. Results showed that the stiffness of the material and the type of gesture affected performance and user experience in complex ways, but with a pervading pattern: using discrete gestures in very short navigation distances and continuous gestures otherwise, plus using lower-stiffness materials in every case, was beneficial in terms of performance and user experience.},

	abstract = {Vibrotactile actuators for small consumer electronic products, such as mobile devices, have been widely used for conveying haptic sensation to users. One of the most important things in vibrotactile actuators is to be developed in the form of thin actuator which can be easily embedded into mobile devices and to provide vibrotactile signals with wide frequency band to users. Thus, this paper proposes a thin film type haptic actuator with an aim to convey vibrotactile information with high frequency bandwidth to users in mobile devices. To this end, a vibrotactile actuator which creates haptic sensation is designed and constructed based on cellulose acetate material. A cellulose acetate material charged with an electric potential can generate vibration under the {AC} voltage input. It is found that the motion of the actuator can have concave or convex shape by controlling a polarity of both charged membranes and the actuator performance can be modulated by increasing level of biased electric potential. The experiment clearly shows that the proposed actuator creates enough output force to stimulate human skin with a large frequency bandwidth and to simulate various vibrotactile sensations to users.},

The {SpatDIF} core is a lightweight minimal solution providing the most essential set of descriptors for spatial sound scenes. Additional descriptors are introduced as extensions, expanding the namespace and scope with respect to authoring, scene description, rendering, and reproduction of spatial sound. A general overview presents the principles informing the specification, as well as the structure and the terminology of the {SpatDIF} syntax. Two use cases exemplify {SpatDIF's} potential for pre-composed pieces as well as interactive installations, and several prototype implementations that have been developed show its real-life utility.},

	abstract = {Haptic cues take on meaning as a function of the context in which they are experienced. In interaction with objects in the physical environment, the context always includes a mechanical contact, at which point force and motion variables can be identified, and across which power may flow. In interaction with objects in a virtual or remote environment, it is not necessary for the contact across which haptic responses are rendered to be the same as the contact at which exploratory actions are applied. In this paper, we ask whether force/motion coupling has a significant impact on manual performance or cognitive load. We conducted an experiment in which n=7 participants attempted, while acting through a teleoperator, to discriminate three objects by their stiffness under two conditions. In one condition physical force/motion coupling was present, in the other it was not. To assess cognitive load, we engaged participants in a simultaneous cognitive task that included a response time measure. Results indicated no difference in manual discrimination performance. After rejecting the datasets of three of our participants based on inconsistent strategy by condition, we observed a small, non-significant trend toward lower cognitive load in the condition with physical coupling. Establishing a robust trend will require additional participants. While results are preliminary, we offer our paradigm as an important direction for new inquiry into the distinctions and interrelationships between information and its presentation in various haptic interface applications. Our work is aimed in particular at developing haptic feedback for use in prosthetic applications.},

	abstract = {Abstract In computational approaches to the study of variation among folk song melodies from oral culture, both global and local features of melodies have been used. From a computational point of view, the representation of a melody as a vector of global feature values, each summarizing an aspect of the entire melody, is attractive. However, from an annotation study on perceived melodic similarity and human categorization in music it followed that local features of melodies are most important to classify and recognize melodies. We compare both approaches in a computational classification task. In both cases, the discriminative power of features is assessed. We use a feature evaluation criterion that is based on the performance of a nearest-neighbour classifier. As distance measure for vectors of global features, we use the Euclidian distance. For the sequences of local features, we use the score of the {Needleman–Wunsch} alignment algorithm. In each of our comparisons, the local features correspond to the global features. In all cases, it appears that the local approach outperforms the global approach in a classification task for melodies, which indicates that local features carry more information about the identity of melodies. Therefore, locality is a crucial factor in modelling melodic similarity among folk song melodies.},

The assistance level determines the amount of support provided by the assistant. It should be adapted autonomously such that task performance and human effort are optimized. The effect of the assistance level on task performance and human effort may, however, be different depending on whether human and assistant agree on the actions or not. In this paper, we investigate the effect of the assistance level on task performance and effort for a scenario, in which human and assistant agree and for a scenario, where they disagree. We present a force-based criterion for distinguishing between the two scenarios and introduce an approach to optimize the assistance levels for each of the scenarios. Finally we sketch, how the results can be used to develop novel assistance adaptation schemes.},

	abstract = {Mobile Music Touch ({MMT)} helps teach users to play piano melodies while they perform other tasks. {MMT} is a lightweight, wireless haptic music instruction system consisting of fingerless gloves and a mobile Bluetooth enabled computing device, such as a mobile phone. Passages to be learned are loaded into the mobile phone and are played repeatedly while the user performs other tasks. As each note of the music plays, vibrators on each finger in the gloves activate, indicating which finger is used to play each note. We present two studies on the efficacy of {MMT.} The first measures 16 subjects' ability to play a passage after using {MMT} for 30 minutes while performing a reading comprehension test. The {MMT} system was significantly more effective than a control condition where the passage was played repeatedly but the subjects' fingers were not vibrated. The second study compares the amount of time required for 10 subjects to replay short, randomly generated passages using passive training versus active training. Participants with no piano experience could repeat the passages after passive training while subjects with piano experience often could not.},

	abstract = {We present {MIRToolbox}, an integrated set of functions written in Matlab, dedicated to the extraction from audio files of musical features related, among others, to timbre, tonality, rhythm or form. The objective is to offer a state of the art of computational approaches in the area of Music Information Retrieval ({MIR).} The design is based on a modular framework: the different algorithms are decomposed into stages, formalized using a minimal set of elementary mechanisms, and integrating different variants proposed by alternative approaches — including new strategies we have developed —, that users can select and parametrize. These functions can adapt to a large area of objects as input. This paper offers an overview of the set of features that can be extracted with {MIRToolbox}, illustrated with the description of three particular musical features. The toolbox also includes functions for statistical analysis, segmentation and clustering. One of our main motivations for the development of the toolbox is to facilitate investigation of the relation between musical features and music-induced emotion. Preliminary results show that the variance in emotion ratings can be explained by a small set of acoustic features.},

The present study examined haptic contributions in object handover. On each trial one participant held an object and passed it to the other participant at self-selected, fixed or randomly varied positions. In some trials, the receiver wore a glove to attenuate tactile information. The results showed that the passer’s time of grip release relative to contact was later when the transfer location randomly varied or when the receiver wore the glove. On the other hand, forces at contact dropped across trials with negligible effects of glove or transfer location. In conclusion, the present study demonstrated that the dyad reduced redundant forces at contact by forming a stereotypical handover movement in a feedforward manner, while the sensory feedback modulates timing of object handover to avoid premature release of grip by the passer.},

In particular, a feedback stabilized closest point tracking algorithm is utilized for real-time determination of the contour error and online construction of the velocity field. The algorithm augments the system dynamics with a new state, and implements a uniformly asymptotically stable controller to update this new state to continual track the closest point to the robot end-effector. Thanks to its feedback-stabilized core, the algorithm is immune to initialization errors, and robust against drift and numerical noise. Furthermore, requiring simple evaluations of the curve and its unit tangents, the approach is computationally efficient. Applicability and effectiveness of the approach to implement passive contour following tasks have been demonstrated through simulations and experiments with a two degrees-of-freedom haptic interface.},

	abstract = {A novel thin film polydimethylsiloxane ({PDMS)} based flexible tactile micro sensor has been developed for contact traction distribution measurement between an indenter and an object (e.g. finger pad). The tactile sensor is a five layer device consisting of 2 layers of textured patterns sandwiched between 3 layers of {PDMS.} The textured patterns are protected by a thin layer of {PDMS} (25 microns) on each side and are separated by a thicker {PDMS} layer (100 microns). The sensor thus has a total thickness of 150 microns, much less than the thickness of the human fingertip skin. The entire device is fabricated bottom up on a silicon wafer using soft lithography and microfabrication techniques. The sensor is designed to be used with an imaging apparatus (in our case we use an Optical Coherence Tomography ({OCT)} apparatus). The deflection of the patterns due to an applied load is imaged by the {OCT} and is used to estimate the stress at the sensor and object interface by solving the stress inverse problem analytically. Results are presented to illustrate the use of the microsensor to estimate the contact traction distribution due to a spherical indenter of radius 500 μm.},

Puncture trials using an experimental telesurgical apparatus were performed on an artificial membrane to characterize general force ranges at which punctures occur. The average force threshold during puncture was established, and human operators then attempted to apply a maximum force to the membrane without causing a puncture via the telesurgical apparatus. As the surgical tool-tip approached the pre-established force threshold, a wrist-mounted haptuator worn by the operators vibrated a warning. Warnings via different sensory modalities (auditory and tactile) were compared both with and without force feedback. Results show that the use of a warning via either sensory modality decreases the maximum force applied by the operator, thereby decreasing the occurrence of unintentional punctures. The inclusion of force feedback achieved similar results, though task completion times were significantly increased.},

The assessment was carried out using a small haptic interface used to produce force and record the hand trajectory during the execution of tasks requiring rapid and precise movements. The aim of the study was to evaluate the sensorimotor development across a wide age-range (6-13 years) in which dramatic changes in sensorimotor integration and motor skills occur. A mixed-effect analysis was performed in order to evaluate age-related effects and to check for reduction of residual variability within twins with respect to variability across all pairs of twins. We report both an effect of age and of parenthood when considering reaction times and control of position of the hand under perturbed environment. The ability of tracking a moving target and the velocity of information processing show a dependence on age but not on the parenthood factor. This study validates the methodology used to investigate the age effects on the motor behavior of children and promises to provide new insights in twin-studies.},

	url = {http://www.jneurosci.org/content/21/3/1056},
	abstract = {The spatial distribution of learned information within a sensory system can shed light on the brain mechanisms of sensory–perceptual learning. It has been argued that tactile memories are stored within a somatotopic framework in monkeys and rats but within a widely distributed network in humans. We have performed experiments to reexamine the spread of tactile learning across the fingertips. In all experiments, subjects were trained to use one fingertip to discriminate between two stimuli. Experiment 1 required identification of vibration frequency, experiment 2 punctate pressure, and experiment 3 surface roughness. After learning to identify the stimuli reliably, subjects were tested with the trained fingertip, its first and second neighbors on the same hand, and the three corresponding fingertips on the opposite hand. As expected, for all stimulus types, subjects showed retention of learning with the trained fingertip. However, the transfer beyond the trained fingertip varied according to the stimulus type. For vibration, learning did not transfer to other fingertips. For both pressure and roughness stimuli, there was limited transfer, dictated by topographic distance; subjects performed well with the first neighbor of the trained finger and with the finger symmetrically opposite the trained one. These results indicate that tactile learning is organized within a somatotopic framework, reconciling the findings in humans with those in other species. The differential distribution of tactile memory according to stimulus type suggests that the information is stored in stimulus-specific somatosensory cortical fields, each characterized by a unique receptive field organization, feature selectivity, and callosal connectivity.},

	abstract = {Phantom perceptions are an intriguing mystery that captured and still captures the attention of many people: those who are amputated, their relatives, healthcare providers, and even the public. Indeed, it is a mystery: How is it possible to feel sensations and/or motions in a limb or a body part that has obviously been surgically removed? Unfortunately, there is no clear answer to this question. Phantom sensations and especially phantom limb pain remain medical nightmares. Moreover, we can currently not explain why phantom sensations occur in some amputees but do not in others. In the present chapter, we will first report on locations, characteristics, and descriptions of phantom sensations. We then will report on patho-physiological mechanisms that possibly might lead to phantom sensations. Finally, therapeutic options and possible future directions of research and treatment will be given.},

The target feature is then believed to be salient, and the search is performed in a parallel way. We investigated this effect with movable stimuli in a haptic search task. The task was to find a movable ball among anchored distractors or the other way round. Results show that reaction times were independent of the number of distractors if the movable ball was the target but increased with the number of items if the anchored ball was the target. Analysis of hand movements revealed a parallel search strategy, shorter movement paths, a higher average movement speed, and a narrower direction distribution with the movable target, as compared with a more detailed search for an anchored target. Taken together, these results show that a movable object pops out between anchored objects and this indicates that movability is a salient object feature. Vibratory signals resulting from the movable ball were found to be a reasonable explanation regarding the sensation responsible for the pop-out of movability.},

A custom-made high-resolution friction force sensor, able to resolve milli-newton forces, was used to record those fluctuations as well as the net, low-frequency components of the interaction force. Measurements show that the fluctuations of the sliding force are highly non-stationary. Despite their randomness, force spectra averages reveal regularities. With a smooth, flat, but not mirror-finish, surface the background noise follows a 1/f trend. Recordings made with pure-tone sinusoidal gratings reveal complexities in the interaction between a finger and a surface. The fundamental frequency is driven by the periodicity of the gratings and harmonics follow a non-integer power-law decay that suggests strong nonlinearities in the fingertip interaction. The results are consistent with the existence of a multiplicity of simultaneous and rapid stick-slip relaxation oscillations. Results have implications for high fidelity haptic rendering and biotribology.},

From this, we examine how the modulator signal can be created with nonlinear distortion methods, looking at the classic case of phase-aligned formant synthesis and then our own modified frequency-modulation technique.

To scale the utility demonstrated for small icon sets to larger ones, we need efficient strategies to help users learn subtle distinctions among stimuli, in a modality for which they may not hold detailed descriptive percepts. This paper investigates the effect of naming haptic stimuli - i.e. explicitly creating a linguistic marker - on the accuracy with which users are able to identify, distinguish, and recall stimuli. We conducted a between-subjects experiment using 60 participants equally divided among three naming conditions: no names, pre-selected non-descriptive names, and self-selected names. The experiment examined the impact of naming strategy on the ability of participants to identify stimuli in a nonverbal matching test, and on remembering stimulus names. For this challenging task and the degree of learning afforded, naming did not significantly impact accuracy of matching stimuli to meanings for all participants. However, more than twice of many of those allowed to choose names reported the ability to remember and distinguish stimuli than those required to use non-descriptive names, and many participants felt that the names were useful. Of middle-performing participants, the self-selected names group performed significantly better than the non-descriptive names group, and appeared to progress more quickly in learning. We summarize evidence for a trend that might widen with refined naming strategies and more extensive learning.},

Although subjects preferred it, we found that the addition of tactile feedback did not affect motion tracking performance. We also found no strong preference or performance differences between attractive and repulsive tactile feedback. Some factors that may have influenced these results include the speed and the complexity of the tested motions, the type of tactile actuators and drive signals used, and inconsistencies in joint angle estimation due to Euler angle gimbal lock. We discuss insights from this analysis and provide suggestions for future systems and studies in tactile motion guidance.},

Four kinds of annotation are identified from 8 years of studies of mutual engagement through distributed music-making systems.

The aim was to analyse the stimuli-dependant changes in the subjects {EEG.} The more than 30 probands in this trial had, as expected, no major problems meeting this demand. However, much to our surprise, one test subject was completely unable to perform the task. Her exploratory times were much longer than the average. Despite this, the drawn reproductions that she produced showed that her perception of the stimuli’s entire structure was completely false and distorted.},

Historically, the majority of the research on this topic has focused on interactions in the perception of stationary stimuli, but given that the majority of stimuli in the world move, an important question concerns the extent to which principles derived from stationary stimuli also apply to moving stimuli. A key finding emerging from recent work with moving stimuli is that our perception of stimulus movement in one modality is frequently, and unavoidably, modulated by the concurrent movement of stimuli in other sensory modalities. Visual motion has a particularly strong influence on the perception of auditory and tactile motion. These behavioral results are now being complemented by the results of neuroimaging studies that have pointed out the existence of both modality-specific motion-processing areas and areas involved in processing motion in more than one sense. The challenge for the future will be to develop novel experimental paradigms that can integrate behavioral and neuroscientific approaches in order to refine our understanding of multisensory contributions to the perception of movement.},

	abstract = {This paper describes the system development of an admittance-controlled 2-dof haptic device using electrostatic motors. The unique point of the device is that all components including the motors and sensors are fabricated using non ferromagnetic materials to realize operation in a strong magnetic field. The device consists of an operation handle, two electrostatic motor units and two optical force sensors, and is an improved version of our previous development. The new device has stiffer platforms, improved force sensors, and newly fabricated driving electronics. The employed electrostatic motor is one of the strongest electrostatic actuators and can generate thrust force of several newtons. To operate a motor unit, two three-phase signals are required and they have to be amplified to over 1 {kV.} In our previous development, the signals were amplified by six large commercial amplifiers, which was not practical enough considering the portability of the system. This work developed an original driving electronics for the motor using Field Programmable Gate Array ({FPGA)} and step-up transformers to reduce the system size. The device was implemented on one of the major haptic toolkits, {CHAI} {3D.} To be able to run sample impedance-type programs without any modifications, we implemented our device to behave like impedance-type on {CHAI} {3D.}},

For example, it is now apparent that many cortical areas previously thought to be specialized for processing specific aspects of visual input are also activated during analogous haptic or tactile tasks. In this chapter, we review the circumstances in which haptic or tactile tasks are associated with visual cortical activity and what this means for our internal representation of the external world, i.e., how information about objects and events in the external world is stored in memory. By ‘haptic’, we mean tasks involving active motor exploration of stimuli, whereas ‘tactile’ refers here to tasks in which stimuli are applied to the passive finger or other skin surface.},

We investigate the efficacy of a skin stretch device for artificially relaying proprioception during a spring discrimination task, with the goal of enabling the task to be achieved in the absence of vision. In this study, intact users perceive the location of a virtual prosthetic limb using each of four sensory conditions: Vision, Proprioception, Skin Stretch, and Skin Stretch with Vision. For the conditions with skin stretch, a haptic device stretches the forearm skin by an amount proportional to the angular rotation of a virtual prosthetic limb. Sensory condition was not found to significantly influence task performance, exploration methods, or perceived usefulness. We conclude that, in the absence of vision, artificial skin stretch could be used by prosthesis wearers to obtain position/motion information and identify the behavior of a spring.},

Feedback of grasping pressure is critical in many microsurgical tasks, yet no haptic interface for surgical tools is commercially {available.MethodsLiterature} on the psychophysics of touch was reviewed to define the spectrum of human touch perception and the fidelity requirements of an ideal haptic interface. Mechanical design and control literature was reviewed to translate the psychophysical requirements to engineering specification. High-fidelity haptic forceps were then developed through an iterative process between engineering and {surgery.ResultsThe} forceps are a modular device that integrate with a haptic hand controller to add force feedback for tool actuation in telerobotic or virtual surgery. Their overall length is 153 mm and their mass is 125 g. A contact-free voice coil actuator generates force feedback at frequencies up to 800 Hz. Maximum force output is 6 N ({2N} continuous) and the force resolution is 4 {mN.} The forceps employ a contact-free magnetic position sensor as well as micro-machined accelerometers to measure opening/closing acceleration. Position resolution is 0.6 µm with 1.3 µm {RMS} noise. The forceps can simulate stiffness greater than {20N/mm} or impedances smaller than 15 g with no noticeable haptic artifacts or {friction.ConclusionAs} telerobotic surgery evolves, haptics will play an increasingly important role.

The inversion effect (better recognition of upright than inverted patterns) and the part-whole effect (better recognition of the whole than a part pattern), traditionally considered signatures of visual expertise, were observed for tactile experts but not for novices. In a second study, participants were trained as visual or tactile experts and then tested in the trained and nontrained modalities. Whereas expertise effects were observed in the modality of training, cross-modal transfer was asymmetric; visual experts showed generalization to haptic recognition, but tactile experts did not show generalization to visual recognition. Tactile expertise is not obviously attributable to visual mediation and emerges from domain-general principles that operate independently of modality.},

The paper also describes a distributed multimedia-mapping server which allows multiplatform and multisensory integrations and presents a sample application which integrates a real-time face tracking system. Ongoing developments and plausible future explorations on stage augmentation with virtual and augmented realities as well as gesture analysis on the correlations of musical gesture and physical gesture are also discussed.},

	abstract = {Touchscreens are becoming more and more popular, especially in mobile devices. There is also clear evidence of the benefits of tactile feedback in touchscreen interaction. However, the effect of the evident latency in interaction has been completely neglected in earlier investigations of touchscreen interaction. In this study we examined the effect of tactile feedback latencies on the usability of a touchscreen keypad. We used a realistic use case for number and character keypads; users entered three-number sequences and short sentences using the virtual buttons on the touch display. The experiments differed from each other in terms of the tactile feedback type (press-only or for press and release) and the keypad layout (number or {QWERTY).} The results were unexpected, but consistent in all three experiments: The performance did not drop significantly within the latency values used. However, the users evaluated the keypad with the shortest feedback latency more pleasant to use compared to others. We can conclude that latency makes the user experience worse, even though performance does not decrease significantly.},

The second investigated haptic guidance which waxed and waned as the user violated program rules by varying amounts. The third experiment investigated whether this latter artificial guidance would inhibit the user's free will by taking control out of their hands. The results showed that a significant improvement in both accuracy and speed was achieved by the introduction of haptics in all experiments. It also found that the haptic guidance did not take control away from the user and that they had significantly more control than with conventional warning methods. These experiments were not aimed at learning, or retention of skill, but on using haptics as an aid to improve performance during a task.},

We review new findings indicating that a regressive process – perceptual narrowing – also contributes in critical ways to perceptual development. These new data reveal that young infants are able to integrate non-native faces and vocalizations, that this broad multisensory perceptual tuning is present at birth, and that this tuning narrows by the end of the first year of life, leaving infants with the ability to integrate only socio-ecologically-relevant multisensory signals. This narrowing process forces us to reconsider the traditional progressive theories of multisensory development and opens up several new evolutionary questions as well.},

This paper aims to build a robust model for the perceived intensities of mobile device vibrations, which can be used by engineers and application designers. We carried out two psychophysical experiments using absolute magnitude estimation procedures. In Exp. I, we investigated the effects of vibration direction and device weight on the perceived intensity of mobile device vibrations. Only the vibration direction was found to be a statistically significant factor, showing the highest perceived intensities along the height direction of a mobile device. In Exp. {II}, we measured the perceived intensities of vibrations with various amplitudes and frequencies along the three vibration directions. Then, for each direction, a psychophysical magnitude function and equal sensation contours were constructed based on Stevens\&amp;\#8217; power law. In addition, we found a monotonic relationship between the physical power of vibration absorbed by the hand and the resulting perceived intensity. This suggests that the former, which is greatly easier to acquire in practice, is a reliable predictor of the latter. We expect that the results of this study can provide knowledge about the perceptual strength of vibrations that engineers and applications developers will find useful.},

In this paper we introduce an experimental handheld sensor-actuator device that responds dynamically to user's motion. With the device we explored the potential of continuous audiotactile feedback in closed-loop gesture interaction, designed simple synthesis methods for feedback, and tested the user perception. We designed four simple textures that respond to overall angular velocity of the device, all with different velocity responses. The system enabled us to examine how well subjects can distinguish the textures on the fly. Our preliminary findings show that audio modality dominates the perception. Tactile feedback worked quite well alone but the modalities together didn't lead to any better performance than audio alone.},

The integration of e-stripes and conductive threads into the woven textiles is compatible with commercial weaving processes and suitable for large-scale manufacturing. We demonstrate the technology with a woven textile containing five e-stripes with digital temperature sensors. Conductive threads interconnect the e-stripes among each other to form a bus topology. We show that the contacts between the conductive threads and the pads on e-stripes as well as the contacts between the temperature sensors and e-stripes withstand shear forces of at least 20 N. The integration of the temperature sensors into the textile increases the bending rigidity of the textile by 30\%; however, it is still possible to obtain a textile-bending radii of {\textless};1 mm. This technology seamlessly integrates electronics into textiles, thus advancing the field of smart textiles and wearable computing.},

From the results, a model for the impedance was fitted and thresholds for the perception of deflections were calculated. These were compared to already published thresholds from other research groups. The results show a good fit of both data sets, therefore confirming the mechanical impedance as coupling parameter between these two dimensions of perception.},

Several models exist that explain expressive variations over the course of a performance, for example in terms of phrase structure, or musical accent. Often however expressive markings are written explicitly in the score to guide performers. We present a modelling framework for musical expression that is especially suited to model the influence of such markings, along with any other information from the musical score. In two separate experiments, we demonstrate the modelling framework for both predictive and explanatory modelling. Together with the results of these experiments, we discuss our perspective on computational modelling of musical expression in relation to musical creativity.},

	abstract = {Abstract We present interdisciplinary research undertaken for the development of an ‘augmented’ string quartet. Hardware and software components were especially designed to enable mixed acoustic/electronic music where bow gestures drive digital sound processes. Precisely, inertial motion sensors and a bow force sensor were added to each musician's bow, and dedicated modules allowed forthe wireless data transmission to an on-line gesture analysis system. Prior to the performance, a research phase was performed to evaluate qualitatively the variability of the gesture data. Recording sessions of both gesture and audio data were carried out with a professional string quartet. The music material included a set of prototypical musical phrases containing various bowing styles and playing techniques as well as a complete music composition. The analysis of the recorded sessions allowed us to compare the consistency within and between players. While a given player was found to be generally consistent, the comparison between players revealed significant gesture idiosyncrasies. These results helped us to adapt a real-time gesture analysis system called the gesture follower. This tool was successful to automatically synchronize the live performance with electronic sound transformation in two concerts. A quantitative assessment is reported on a specific section of the piece, illustrating the accuracy and the types of errors encountered.},

Haptic feedback is a key feature for every surgery simulator for the training of hand-eye coordination. To address the need for higher fidelity and complexity in an endoscopic simulator, we have designed a new haptic interface, instrumented a clinical endoscope and integrated it with a software simulation for colonoscopy. The proposed haptic interface provides high translational force and rotational torque with combined electrical motors and passive brakes. This paper presents the evaluation of the haptic interface. Experimental analyzes are performed for characterization and performance evaluation. A model-based feed-forward control is implemented and the results show that the control successfully compensates for the device dynamics and nonlinearities such as Coulomb and viscous friction.},

Particularly stroke is the leading cause for disability in all industrialised countries; the incidence is approximately one million patients in the European Union each year [1, 2]. Modern concepts of motor learning favour a task specific training, i.e., to relearn walking, the patient should ideally train all walking movements, needed in daily life, repetitively in a physically correct manner [3]. Conventional training methods based on this approach proved to be effective, e.g., treadmill training [4], but they require great physical effort from the physiotherapists to assist the patient — so does even more training of free walking guided by at least two physiotherapists.},

	abstract = {Amplitude-modulated vibrotactile stimuli have been broadly used for tactile perception and rendering research. However, understandings of the perceptual relations between amplitude-modulated vibrations are not comprehensive yet. In this paper, we present a perceptual analysis on the identifying characteristics of amplitude-modulated vibrations and their perceptual relations. We estimated the perceptual dissimilarities among one carrier and seven amplitude-modulated sinusoidal vibrations (150-Hz carrier frequency; seven modulation frequencies in 1-80 Hz) in a psychophysical experiment. The dissimilarity scores were inspected using multi-dimensional scaling to obtain an appropriate perceptual space. The optimal perceptual space was two-dimensional, where the vibration points exhibited a circular formation. The analysis showed that the pulse-like low-frequency sensation of an amplitude-modulated vibration increased for very low modulation frequencies (1-10 Hz), then decreased for higher modulation frequencies (10-80 Hz), and eventually converged to the smooth vibrational sensation of the 150-Hz carrier signal. It also suggested that the envelope waveform is primary information for the discrimination of amplitude-modulated signals, instead of their spectral energy distributions. These findings can contribute to the design of perceptually salient and distinctive vibrotactile signals using amplitude modulation.},

In particular, we are interested in investigating how data representations that address haptic/tactile and sonic perception are experienced. We describe the creation of a number of data-driven artifacts that all represent the same dataset. In taking a phenomenological approach to our analysis, we used the Repertory Grid Technique ({RGT)} during a group session to elicit participant’s personal constructs, which are used to describe and compare these artifacts. Our analysis examines these, traces the emergence of one exemplary personal construct and highlights other emergent themes. Our findings consist of a number of elicited constructs that illuminate how the affective qualities of data driven artifacts relate to the type of modality in use.},

In this context, the choice of suitable local cost or distance measures is of crucial importance, since they determine the kind of (spatial) similarity between the elements (frames) of the two sequences to be aligned. For the mocap domain, we introduce two conceptually different local distance measures – one based on joint angle parameters and the other based on {3D} coordinates – and discuss their respective strengths and weaknesses (Sect. 10.1). The importance of {DTW} is then illustrated by some synthesis and analysis applications (Sect. 10.2). By comparing a motion data stream to itself, one obtains a cost or distance matrix that exhibits self-similarities within the motion. In Sect. 10.3, we describe how this idea can be exploited for motion retrieval. Finally, in Sect. 10.4, we discuss some work related to {DTW-based} motion retrieval.},

	abstract = {Abstract Listening to sounds or music is not a homogeneous act of grasping meanings by hearing. Yet it is often portrayed as such, especially when the intentional stance of a listener is overlooked. This paper distinguishes listening as the action-oriented intentional activity of making sense of the world. It is proposed that the multifaceted and heterogeneous nature of ‘understanding by listening’ can be outlined in terms of distinct modes of listening. Building upon previous accounts, a revised taxonomy of nine listening modes (reflexive, kinaesthetic, connotative, causal, empathetic, functional, semantic, reduced and critical listening) is proposed and illustrated by examples. Modes refer to different constituents of meaning-creation in the process of listening. In the taxonomy, they are schematically arranged into three levels (experiential, denotative and reflective). The theoretical framework of this revised taxonomy utilizes an embodied cognition paradigm. The experiential basis of meaning in listening is theoretically conceived of as emerging resonances between experiential patterns of sensations, structured patterns of recurrent sensorimotor experiences (action–sound couplings) and the projection of action-relevant mental images. The proposed taxonomy of listening modes is discussed in terms of its implications for perception and cognition research on sounds and music.},

	abstract = {Given a class of semantically related motions, we have derived a class motion template that captures the consistent as well as the inconsistent aspects of all motions in the class. The application of {MTs} to automatic motion annotation and retrieval, which is the content of this chapter, is based on the following interpretation: the consistent aspects of a class {MT} represent the class characteristics that are shared by all motions, whereas the inconsistent aspects represent the class variations that are due to different realizations. The key idea in designing a distance measure for comparing a class {MT} with unknown motion data is to mask out the inconsistent aspects – a kind of class-dependent adaptive feature selection – so that related motions can be identified even in the presence of significant spatio-temporal variations. In Sect. 14.1, we define such a distance measure, which is based on a subsequence variant of {DTW.} Our concepts of {MT-based} annotation and retrieval are then described in Sect. 14.2 and Sect. 14.3, respectively, where we also report on our extensive experiments [143, 144]. To substantially speed up the annotation and retrieval process, we introduce an index-based (the index being independent of the class {MTs)} preprocessing step to cut down the set of candidate motions by using suitable keyframes (Sect. 14.4). In Sect. 14.5, we compare {MT-based} matching to several baseline methods (based on numerical features) as well as to adaptive fuzzy querying. Finally, related work and future research directions are discussed Sect. 14.6.},

Since environmental changes occur on different time scales ranging from milliseconds to hundreds of centuries, nature provides an arsenal of different mechanisms and strategies of adaptation. Immediate adaptations are necessary in life-threatening situations. Alternatively, changes in climate, food availability, and the appearance of competitors and predators alter an individual’s behaviour, and might, on a longer timescale, even shape organisms across generations. Adaptation of the latter type occurs mainly on an evolutionary basis, which acts on genetic information. In contrast, adaptation referring to changes in individual’s behaviour is realised by learning which is mediated on a neuronal level.},

Intuitively, the sequences are warped in a nonlinear fashion to match each other. Originally, {DTW} has been used to compare different speech patterns in automatic speech recognition, see [170]. In fields such as data mining and information retrieval, {DTW} has been successfully applied to automatically cope with time deformations and different speeds associated with time-dependent data. In this chapter, we introduce and discuss the main ideas of classical {DTW} (Sect. 4.1) and summarize several modifications concerning local as well as global parameters (Sect. 4.2). To speed up classical {DTW}, we describe in Sect. 4.3 a general multiscale {DTW} approach. In Sect. 4.4, we show how {DTW} can be employed to identify all subsequence within a long data stream that are similar to a given query sequence (Sect. 4.4). A discussion of related alignment techniques and references to the literature can be found in Sect. 4.5.},

We present two possible approaches to interactive annotation applied to compositions of acousmatic music, namely John Chowning's Turenas and Denis Smalley's Wind Chimes. We also discuss the potential impact of such semi-automatic annotation on the theoretical consideration and practice of acousmatic music.},

It was observed that the passivity condition for multiple ports may lead to some oscillations in some coordinate directions even though total energy is positive. The passivity condition, therefore, needs to be applied to each orthogonal coordinate. For guaranteeing stability in each orthogonal coordinate, the {EBA} is applied. For multiple-dof haptic interaction, however, the {EBA} in each coordinate may cause a problem that the direction of the rendered force vector is distorted. This problem can easily be solved by projecting the direction of the rendered force vector on its original direction. The validity of the proposed algorithm is shown by some experiments.},

An ergotic gesture-sound situation is a situation where the instrumental gesture and the sound produced are intimately energetically linked. We perform two sets of experiments: the first aims at identifying the respective role of haptic and auditory perceptions in recognition of a virtual object, here a virtual bowed string; the second aims at evaluating the role of haptic and auditory perceptions with respect to action, in the achievement of a difficult musical task. The musical goal consists in maintaining the continuity of sound when changing bow direction. The first experiments are subjective experiments. They show that the feeling of presence of the bowed string is strongly reinforced when sounds and gestural friction are intimately linked, as is the case when the vibrations of the string are returned to the fingers. The second are subjective and objective experiments. They show that achieving the goal is significantly improved by instrumental force feedback. Further, they show that the main property of subjects' performance with the virtual bowed string is fast adaptive dynamic learning due to the physical relation between action plus gesture perception and auditory perception, and that playing and embodiment are notably improved by a strong physical haptic resistance.},

	abstract = {We applied and validated a quantitative allodynia assessment technique, using a recently developed rat surgical neuropathy model wherein nocifensive behaviors are evoked by light touch to the paw. Employing von Frey hairs from 0.41 to 15.1 g, we first characterized the percent response at each stimulus intensity. A smooth log-linear relationship was observed, with a median 50\% threshold at 1.97 g (95\% confidence limits, 1.12–3.57 g). Subsequently, we applied a paradigm using stimulus oscillation around the response threshold, which allowed more rapid, efficient measurements. Median 50\% threshold by this up-down method was 2.4 g (1.81–2.76). Correlation coefficient between the two methods was 0.91. In neuropathic rats, good intra- and inter-observer reproducibility was found for the up-down paradigm; some variability was seen in normal rats, attributable to extensive testing. Thresholds in a sizable group of neuropathic rats showed insignificant variability over 20 days. After 50 days, 61\% still met strict neuropathy criteria, using survival analysis. Threshold measurement using the up-down paradigm, in combination with the neuropathic pain model, represents a powerful tool for analyzing the effects of manipulations of the neuropathic pain state.},

We present a decomposition approach to the automated design of perceptually augmented simulations, and we describe a user-study of the training effectiveness of a search-task simulator designed using our approach vs. an un-augmented simulator. The results indicate that our decomposition approach allows existing psychophysical findings to be leveraged in the design of haptic simulators that effectively impart skill by targeting perceptually significant aspects of the interaction.},

In addition, the proposed interface enables human operators to give commands to (or drive) target vehicle in a way which is carried out in traditional direct control or driving. Experiments have been done to carefully evaluate and test the performance of the proposed interface. The results have shown that the developed haptic master device is sufficient and suitable for general wheeled and tracked-vehicle teleoperation.},

	abstract = {This paper introduces a distributed haptic control architecture that can render direct interaction between users in addition to cooperative manipulation of virtual objects. The proposed architecture integrates remote dynamic proxies and peer-to-peer wave-based communications. Remote dynamic proxies are avatars of users at peer sites with motion governed by second order dynamics laws. They render physically-based motion of the distant users in the presence of update discontinuities caused by packet transmission limitations. They also enable users to touch their far away peers directly. The remote dynamic proxies are integrated with peer-to-peer wave-based communications by using wave variable controllers to connect the distributed copies of the shared virtual object, and to connect the users to their remote dynamic proxies. The proposed distributed control architecture is compared via experiments to peer-to-peer haptic cooperation with wave variable time delay compensation. The results illustrate that remote dynamic proxies with wave-based communications: (1) improve position coherency between the distributed copies of the shared virtual object; (2) render mass more faithfully in the presence of network delay; and (3) permit users to interact with each other directly in addition to enabling them to cooperatively manipulate the shared virtual object.},

The electronic medium has the possibility, where desirable, to bypass the performer who has traditionally acted as the intermediary between the composer and the audience. In order to accomplish these things I needed to develop a software which was always ‘in service’ to the composer/musician, To this end, I with Mark Coniglio, developed the software language, Interactor®. In addition to the software, I have developed a kind of philosophy regarding the use of electronics in music/art making. What follows is an outline of some of these conclusions regarding real time interaction with the computer in performance. There are at least three kinds of interactive environments: public performances, installations, and home media, however, in this article I will concentrate on the area of performance. Two basic modes for the use of computer in performance. 1-Background (transparent) mode. 2-Forefront mode.},

In this paper we describe a prototype system designed to enrich the experience of music for the deaf by enhancing sensory input of information via channels other than in-air audio reception by the ear. The system has two main components-a vibrating {'Haptic} Chair' and a computer display of informative visual effects that correspond to features of the music. The Haptic Chair provides sensory input of vibrations via touch. This system was developed based on an initial concept guided by information obtained from a background survey conducted with deaf people from multi-ethnic backgrounds and feedback received from two profoundly deaf musicians. A formal user study with 43 deaf participants suggested that the prototype system enhances the musical experience of a deaf person.

One of the challenges in the design is the selection of appropriate boundary conditions and the piezo configurations (location and orientation) on the screen for achieving optimum performance within the limits of human haptic perception. To investigate the trade-offs in our design, we developed a finite element model of the screen and four piezo actuators attached to its surface in {ABAQUS.} The model utilizes the well-known Hooke’s law between stress and strain extended by piezoelectric coupling. After selecting the appropriate boundary condition for the screen based on the range of vibration frequencies detectable by a human finger, the optimum configuration for the piezo patches is determined by maximizing the vibration amplitude of the screen for a unit micro Coulomb charge applied to each piezo patch. The results of our study suggest that the piezo patches should be placed close to the clamped sides of the screen where the boundary conditions are applied.},

The synthesis method described here combines techniques and concepts from physical modeling and convolution to produce audio synthesis of percussive instruments. This synthesis method not only achieves a high degree of realism in comparison with audio samples but also retains some of the flexibility associated with waveguide physical models. When the results are analyzed, the method exhibits some interesting detailed spectral features that have some aspects in common with the behavior of acoustic percussion instruments. In addition to outlining the synthesis process, the article discusses some of the more creative possibilities inherent in this approach, e.g., the use and free combination of excitation and resonance sources from beyond the realms of the purely percussive examples given.},

	abstract = {Sliding a probe over a textured surface generates a rich collection of vibrations that one can easily use to create a mental model of the surface. Haptic virtual environments attempt to mimic these real interactions, but common haptic rendering techniques typically fail to reproduce the sensations that are encountered during texture exploration. Past approaches have focused on building a representation of textures using a priori ideas about surface properties. Instead, this paper describes a process of synthesizing probe-surface interactions from data recorded from real interactions. We explain how to apply the mathematical principles of Linear Predictive Coding ({LPC)} to develop a discrete transfer function that represents the acceleration response under specific probe-surface interaction conditions. We then use this predictive transfer function to generate unique acceleration signals of arbitrary length. In order to move between transfer functions from different probe-surface interaction conditions, we develop a method for interpolating the variables involved in the texture synthesis process. Finally, we compare the results of this process with real recorded acceleration signals, and we show that the two correlate strongly in the frequency domain.},

We provide the musicians with vibrotactile feedback about their bowing and posture using vibration motors that are positioned on their arms and torso. We describe a user study with novice violin players that compared a group who was trained using vibrotactile feedback with a control group who only received conventional teaching. We found that vibrotactile feedback is effective at improving novices' straight bowing technique and that half of these subjects continued to show improved bowing technique even when they no longer received vibrotactile feedback.

In Sect. 12.1, we will formally introduce the concepts of exact hits, fuzzy hits, and adaptive fuzzy hits. We then describe how one can compute such hits using an inverted file index. The proposed indexing and matching techniques can be put to use in a variety of query modes. Here, the possibilities range from isolated pose-based queries up to query-by-example ({QBE)}, where the user supplies the system with a short query motion clip. In Sect. 12.2, we present a flexible and efficient {QBE-based} motion retrieval system and report on experimental results. Furthermore, we show how our relational approach to motion comparison can be used as a general tool for efficient motion preprocessing (Sect. 12.3). Finally, we discuss some problems and limitation of the presented index-based techniques and close with a discussion of related work (Sect. 12.4).},

The quintessential example of this process may be a beginning golfer struggling to learn to putt, where strokes must be precise and consistent in order to place the ball in the hole. This paper presents a four-cable haptic device designed to help golfers learn to improve their putting accuracy. This planar three-{DOF} system provides feedback that consists of two Cartesian forces and one angular moment. We present the system's design and kinematics, along with a closed-loop controller that helps the user keep the putter head at the correct angle in the plane. We evaluated our design through a study in which five subjects used the system to repeatedly putt at a target both with and without assistance. While assistance did not change the mean of the putting distribution, it did significantly affect the variance for some subjects.},

A qualitative study collected data in semi–structured individual interviews from music therapists experienced in using electronic equipment using {MIDI} generated sounds triggered by specialist input devices. Interview transcripts were analyzed independently by two multidisciplinary investigators using open coding procedures from Grounded Theory, with member checking to enhance credibility. The findings propose a five–step treatment model when using technologies with people with complex needs. Accurate assessment of movement, positioning of the technology, and establishing the client's awareness of cause and effect are central to meeting clinical aims. Clinical indicators include complex physical and sensory disabilities, motivational problems, and specific needs pertaining to expression of identity. Their use is contraindicated in cases where it is known the client has no awareness of cause and effect.},

Larger sensor areas are composed from identical sensor modules providing a 16×16 matrix of tactels. We compare different tactel layouts and different force-sensitive materials to achieve optimal sensitivity especially to low forces in order to facilitate detection of first touch.

	abstract = {Replacing the traditional balance training task with tasks in virtual environment in subjects after stroke was a step toward independent rehabilitation. The virtual reality supported balance training relieved the physiotherapist from strenuous work, besides, also enabled rehabilitation treatment on individuals home and functional balance ability assessment. However, adding a haptic floor to the virtual reality balance training enhanced the approach to the postural response training and assessment. We have developed a two degrees of freedom, position controlled, haptic floor plates providing postural perturbations according to the collisions with obstacles in the virtual environment. The subject generated a postural response to stabilize the body during balance training. Such task represents for the subject with stroke a serious challenge. However, the standing frame prevented the possibility to fall. The virtual reality supported balance training with haptic floor was so far carried out in healthy individuals and tested in single subject after stroke. A basic response characteristic of haptic floor was examined. The preliminary results demonstrated a sufficient dynamics of the haptic floor and great acceptability among the participating subjects. Thus the additional haptic feedback in goal based balance training may contribute to the improvement of subject's functional balance and postural abilities and so increase the quality of life. However, to confirm the clinical applicability of the haptic floor in balance training and evaluation of postural responses, a further study including clinical tests within a larger group of stroke population should be carried out.},

The tactile display is an array of 4×4 vertically moving pins which can simulate the shape of small scale features. Its small size and low mass allow users to explore virtual surfaces freely and intuitively. The evaluation method consisted of measuring the orientation discrimination threshold for virtual surfaces with sinusoidal profiles. The threshold was compared with the threshold obtained using a non-actuated tactile display of equal spatial resolution and with the threshold obtained using the bare finger to explore real surfaces. This comparison was done to evaluate the quality of the rendered virtual surfaces, the performance of the device as a control system and the efficiency of the tactile rendering algorithm. This study also measured the speed and normal force during the tactile exploration that allowed investigation of the exploration strategies used when touching through normal indentation displays and through the bare finger. Furthermore they are the necessary interaction parameters for assessing the bandwidth and force output of the device.},

This arm could be touched or not during the presentation of the tactile stimuli.

Critically, we did not find any illusion of ownership related to the hand seen on the screen.

We hypothesize that an important application of such a display will be in teaching visually impaired students concepts that are traditionally learned almost entirely visually. This paper describes initial feasibility studies using a commercially available haptic touchscreen to display grids, points, lines, and shapes - some of the first visual graphical entities students encounter in K-12 mathematics education, and from which more complex lessons can be constructed. We conducted user studies designed to evaluate perception of these objects through haptic feedback alone, auditory feedback alone, and combinations of the two. Our results indicate that both sensory channels can be valuable in user perception.},

Remote haptic virtual environments ({VE)} allow multiple users to interact in the same virtual space to accomplish tasks. Combining these ideas, it is possible to apply a remote {VE} to connect skilled trainers with remote trainees for training. In this paper we examined guided haptic training as an interaction method where one user guides another user through a {VR} simulation. We considered interaction with virtual soft objects, which were pressed and deformed. Within a remote {VE} for guided haptic training, network factors such as delay could influence how the guided user perceives object softness. In this paper, we examined how incongruent delays between the streams of visual and haptic information affect this perception. We found that when haptic information was delayed 133.33 ms beyond visual information there was a statistically significant difference in the perception of object softness. These preliminary observations can be used to locate a threshold for applying to future remote guided {VE} training tools.},

	abstract = {Rapid sequential taps delivered first to one location and then to another on the skin create the somatosensory illusion that the tapping is occurring at intermediate locations between the actual stimulus sites, as if a small rabbit were hopping along the skin from the first site to the second (called the “cutaneous rabbit”). Previous behavioral studies have attributed this illusion to the early unimodal somatosensory body map. A functional magnetic resonance imaging study recently confirmed the association of the illusion with somatotopic activity in the primary somatosensory cortex. Thus, the cutaneous rabbit illusion has been confined to one's own body. In the present paper, however, we show that the cutaneous rabbit can “hop out of the body” onto an external object held by the subject. We delivered rapid sequential taps to the left and right index fingers. When the subjects held a stick such that it was laid across the tips of their index fingers and received the taps via the stick, they reported sensing the illusory taps in the space between the actual stimulus locations (i.e., along the stick). This suggests that the cutaneous rabbit effect involves not only the intrinsic somatotopic representation but also the representation of the extended body schema that results from body–object interactions.},

The result of this is that a pointing device has to travel a much greater distance to navigate the whole of a computer screen. For motion-impaired operators that suffer from fatigue or have a limited range of movement this can make a computer inaccessible. This paper introduces a new method for cursor navigation using the Phantom Omni force-feedback device. The newly proposed workbox is designed to aid the operator with coarse navigation of the cursor and improve target selection. The proposed method can significantly reduce the effect of target distracters, which have been a major hindrance to the development of haptic assistance in graphical user interfaces ({GUI).} The workbox has shown to significantly improve computer access for operators with a limited range of movement by giving them the ability to navigate all of a computer screen.},

The measured root mean square ({RMS)} error in estimating contact force is about 0.2 N, which is suitable for examining subtle human behaviors, such as applying cosmetics. We demonstrated the possible usage of the contact force sensor in combination with a three-axis acceleration sensor. The proposed sensor system is sufficiently small and light when fixed on the fingernail, and is considered to have little constraining or modifying effect on usual haptic behaviors. It should be widely useful for evaluating human haptic procedures in psychological research or ergonomic studies.},

	abstract = {Electric {DC} motors that convert electric current to torque are the most common type of actuators used in haptic interfaces. However, high currents necessary to deliver large haptic forces can generate heat in the electromagnetic coils, and in the extreme can cause malfunctions due to overheating. It is therefore necessary to add thermal protection mechanisms to limit the output current. While this is a common feature of haptic devices, it is not clear what makes a superior current limiting method or what effect such limits have on haptic perception. The current work evaluates three methods for current limiting: limit output to zero, limit output to a safe steady-state current, limit output current in linear proportion to temperature. Using both quantitative and qualitative metrics, these are compared to a control case with no current limit. Human subjects use one finger of a multi finger haptic device to perform a psychophysical thresholding experiment designed to measure human perception of small haptic effects, while forcing the device to heat up. All methods are shown to effectively regulate temperature and show no statistically significant difference in psychophysical threshold value. Users show a slight preference for the linear method, while the zero output method requires less time spent interacting with current limited conditions.},

The input type and the resulting embodiment dramatically influence tabletop interaction: in particular, the touch avoidance that naturally governs people's touching and crossing behavior with physical arms is lost with digital embodiments. One result of this loss is that people are less aware of each others' arms, and less able to coordinate actions and protect personal territories. To determine whether there are strategies that can influence group interaction on shared digital tabletops, we studied augmented digital arm embodiments that provide tactile feedback or movement alterations when people touched or crossed arms. The study showed that both augmentation types changed people's behavior (people crossed less than half as often) and also changed their perception (people felt more aware of the other person's arm, and felt more awkward when touching). This work shows how groupware designers can influence people's interaction, awareness, and coordination abilities when physical constraints are absent.},

	abstract = {In this paper, maneuverability measure of master control devices considering the musculo-skeletal model of operators is proposed. The original maneuverability measure of master arms considering the operator dynamics is extended by introducing a muscle tension space instead of the joint torque space of an operator so that the maneuverability is evaluated under a constant muscle stress condition which is related to muscle fatigue. Unidirectionality of muscle tension forces as well as the gravity effects acting on the master device and the operator arm are explicitly considered to get a correct evaluation. As a numerical example, the effect of a movable armrest installed on a master arm is evaluated based on the proposed measure. It is shown that the armrest is effective to reduce muscle fatigue by not only lowering the gravity loads for the operator but also reducing the gripping force necessary to maneuver the device. Experiments are also conducted to verify the result of this numerical example.},

This phenomenon is due to a reorganization of the sensory systems that are deprived of their normal input through a process called cross-modal plasticity [1]. {‘Rewiring’} studies carried out on ferrets [2] and hamsters [3] provided strong support for these phenomena. For example, lesions of central retinal targets induce the formation of new and permanent retinofugal projections into non-visual thalamic sites such as the auditory nucleus [3]. Single neurons in the auditory cortex of these rewired animals respond to visual stimuli and some of them respond equally well to auditory as to visual stimuli. Moreover, those cells that respond to visual stimuli show properties (e.g., orientation selectivity, motion and direction sensitivity) similar to those encountered in the visual cortex of normal hamsters.},

	abstract = {Tonal Harmony is widely considered to be the most technical and complex part of music theory. Consequently harmonic skills can be hard to acquire. Furthermore, experience of the flexible manipulation of harmony in real time generally requires the ability to play an instrument. Even for those with instrumental skills, it can be difficult to gain clear insight into harmonic abstractions. The above state of affairs gives rise to substantial barriers not only for beginners but also for many experienced musicians. To address these problems, Harmony Space is an interactive digital music system designed to give insight into a wide range of musical tasks in tonal harmony, ranging from performance and composition to analysis. Harmony Space employs a principled set of spatial mappings to offer fluid, precise, intuitive control of harmony. These mappings give rise to sensory-motor and music-theoretic affordances that are hard to obtain in any other way. As a result, harmonic abstractions are rendered amenable to concrete, visible control by simple spatial manipulation. In the language of conceptual metaphor theory, many relationships in tonal harmony become accessible to rapid, universal, low-level, robust human inference mechanisms using image schemata such as containment, contact, centre-periphery, and source-path-goal. This process is more rapid, and imposes far less cognitive load, than slow, abstract symbolic reasoning. Using the above principles, several versions of Harmony Space have been designed to exploit specific interaction styles for different purposes. We note some key variants, such as the desktop version, the camera tracked version, while focusing principally on the most recent version, Song Walker, which employs whole body interaction. Preliminary results from a study of the Song Walker system are outlined, in which both beginners and expert musicians undertook a range of musical tasks involving the performance, composition and analysis of music. Finally, we offer a discussion of the limitations of the current system, and outline directions for future work.},

This study concerns to what extent it is possible to perform the same differentiation considering vibratory tactile stimuli. Three perceptual experiments have been carried out in an attempt to compare discrimination thresholds in terms of spectral differences between auditory and vibratory tactile stimulations. The first test consists of assessing the subject’s ability in discriminating between three signals with distinct spectral content. The second test focuses on the measurement of the discrimination threshold between a pure tone signal and a signal composed of two pure tones, varying the amplitude and frequency of the second tone. Finally, in the third test the discrimination threshold is measured between a tone with even harmonic components and a tone with odd ones. The results show that it is indeed possible to discriminate between haptic signals having the same fundamental frequency but different spectral. The threshold of sensitivity for detection is markedly less than for audio stimuli.},

	abstract = {The vibration behavior of acoustic music instruments, as perceived through touch, is known to play an important role in the interaction between performers and music instruments. This research explores the relevance and utility of including a tactile simulation of this behavior in computer music interfaces, in a snapshot taken during early learning, and including tradeoffs of using this channel for other information. Vibrotactile ({VT)} renderings of different types of sounds were presented to subjects via a handle fitted with vibration actuators. Subjects (1) evaluated consistency of the sound with the {VT} rendering, (2) identified from a “lineup” the {VT} rendering that did not match a sound, and (3) provided data on how inclusion of {VT} cues in a rhythm-tapping task affected perception quality of the {VT} rendering. For the last, a distractor task allowed us to measure both the usability of the cues and the degradation in perception of the {VT} rendering. All renderings were either played directly through vibration transducers, or first altered by modifying the sound's frequency content. {VT} playback was delivered at intensities similar to those experienced in traditional acoustic music instruments. Subjects indicated that specific alterations to the original, direct {VT} rendering were consistent with the source sound more often than the original was, and were able to differentiate between correct and incorrect renderings of a source sound. However, the latter ability was masked when subjects were provided with and able to effectively utilize extra {VT} cues added to the {VT} feedback to improve their performance, suggesting that the {VT} cues were of greater utility than the {VT} mimicking. We discuss the relevance of these findings on the design of computer music interfaces.},

One of the songs included tactile sensations and the other did not. The study found that after 30 minutes, the {PianoTouch} subjects were able to play the song accompanied by tactile sensations better than the non-tactile song.

From a physiological point of view, the production of a simple musical tone relies on the control of the pressure at the lips, the contact force on the mouthpiece, and the oral articulatory gestures and configurations. Whereas previous studies described the magnitude of these control parameters in the quasi-static regime of the oscillation, the present investigation focuses on their temporal evolution and interrelation. Intra-oral pressure, mouthpiece force, facial muscular activity of two groups of muscles, and the radiated sound were recorded from three professional players performing isolated and articulated tones with three different dynamics. Results showed that the experimental conditions affected the amount and location of variability in the performance, and the behaviour of intra-oral pressure at note initiation. All together, this suggests that different dynamics and sequencing may cause a reorganization of the mechanisms underlying the production of a tone.},

More music therapists are being employed in physical medicine and rehabilitation centres, with the goal of using music therapy services to assist in the physical recovery and health maintenance of clients. In spite of the benefits of physical rehabilitation programs, client participation to their full potential is often not observed. Music encourages participation in exercises and activities. Music can ease the discomfort and difficulty associated with exercise and therapy activities, and help ensure consistent participation. One of the goals of the music therapist is to provide a means for the client to express him/herself in a musical activity. Music therapy and rehabilitation medicine are starting to find a common niche in working together with clients who have various neurological, orthopaedic, and paediatric conditions. Therapeutic application of music in rehabilitation contributes to the quality of life of individuals with disabilities. Combined goals could include improving strength, range of motion, balance, communication, and cognition. Continued efforts in clinical practice and research will build on the information already available to further define possible applications of music therapy in rehabilitation, and its outcome and benefits. Occupational therapists can use the therapeutic medium of music, and the services of the music therapy discipline, in assisting clients to maximize their functional independence in their daily occupational roles.},

In scientific psychology, the theoretical and practical problems raised by these deformations have been intensively studied since the end of the 19th Century, and the elements of the figure inducing each error are now identified. However, there is no general theory explaining all the visual illusions. Instead, each figure must be analysed in order to determine the specific processes leading to the error.},

Not only is this useful for users who are blind or partially sighted (who can feel line graphs, for instance), but also the haptic modality can be used alongside other modalities, to increase the amount of variables being presented, or to duplicate some variables to reinforce the presentation. Over the last 20 years, a significant amount of research has been done in haptic data presentation; e.g., researchers have developed force feedback line graphs, bar charts, and other forms of haptic representations. However, previous research is published in different conferences and journals, with different application emphases. This paper gathers and collates these various designs to provide a comprehensive review of designs for haptic data visualization. The designs are classified by their representation: Charts, Maps, Signs, Networks, Diagrams, Images, and Tables.

It was also demonstrated that a tactile analogue of selective auditory attention was possible with this system. Three additional experiments, reported here, indicate that subjects are also able to judge the distance of the sound source and can concurrently judge both the azimuthal direction and distance of a source. Comparisons were made between conditions where head movements were permitted lactive{\textasciitilde} and conditions where the head was held still Ipassive, and between normal auditory judgments and tactile judgments. Active tactile performance was essentially similar to auditory performance. Active performance was superior to passive in both directional and distance judgment, but different components of the motor-sensory complex were found to contribute to active superiority in the two tasks. The implication of these experiments for the design of auditory prosthetic devices is discussed.},

	abstract = {For realizing a tactile display for a handheld device, active touch movement should be represented on a small interface. We propose the addition of a tactile feedback mechanism for a pointing-stick-type ({PS)} input device. In this study, we describe a method for enabling virtual active touch with a cursor on the screen operated by the {PS-type} tactile interface without actual touch movement. First, to validate our concept, we compared tactile detection capabilities of roughness information represented by the {PS-type} tactile interface and the interface with actual touch movement. The experimental results showed that the {PS-type} tactile interface exhibited almost the same ability as the interface involving actual touch movement. We also found that the force-to-velocity scaling factor of the cursor movement had a significant influence on the roughness detection capability of the interface. In addition, to apply our method to devices having small screens, such as mobile phones, we tried to restrict the cursor velocity in proportion to the object size that appears on the screen. The experimental results showed that the {PS-type} tactile interface can represent almost the same roughness information as the original object size.},

	abstract = {Within the {HapCath} - haptic catheter - project an assistive system for interventional catheterizations has been developed. Conventional navigation during catheterization is done by direct manipulation of a handle at a guide wire's proximal end. With the aid of X-ray imaging the corresponding movement of the distal tip within the patient can be monitored. Depending on the practical experience of the medical expert and on the varying complexity of the treatment, the procedure differs in duration and X-ray exposure dose of up to 300\%. The aim of the {HapCath-System} is to reduce duration and exposure dose by simplifying the procedure. The implemented method is to measure the contact forces at the distal tip of the guide wire and feed these measured forces back onto the proximal end of the guide wire to enable tactile feedback and allow for haptic control of the guide wire. The system gives exact measures for the contact force of the guide wire's tip and vessel walls to the physician. The demonstration system of {HapCath} includes an artificial artery system, within these the user will be able to maneuver the haptic guide wire and will be able to recognize different types of plaques by touching the calcifications with the guide wire tip. The system is set up to experience different levels of haptic assistance. The discrete tasks of catheterizations can be performed with visual or haptic feedback either, or with visual and haptic feedback simultaneously.},

To demonstrate the potentials of our {MIR} techniques, we have developed the {SyncPlayer} system [114], which is a client-server based advanced audio player. The {SyncPlayer} integrates novel functionalities for multimodal presentation of audio as well as symbolic data and comprises a search engine for lyrics and other metadata. In Sect. 8.1, we give an overview of the {SyncPlayer} system, which consists of a server as well as a client component. The server component, as will be described in Sect. 8.2, includes functionalities such as audio identification, data retrieval, and data delivery. In contrast, the client component constitutes the user front end of the system and provides the user interfaces for the services offered by the server (Sect. 8.3). A discussion of related work and possible extensions of our system can be found in Sect. 8.4. A demo version of the {SyncPlayer} is available at [199].},

In a task which required a large amount of cognitive processing, it became difficult for subjects to maintain high levels of performance in both modalities and the distribution of attention became an important determinant of performance.

	abstract = {The design of a digital musical instrument is often informed by the needs of the first performance or composition. Following the initial performances, the designer frequently confronts the question of how to build a larger community of performers and composers around the instrument. Later musicians are likely to approach the instrument on different terms than those involved in the design process, so design decisions that promote a successful first performance will not necessarily translate to broader uptake. This article addresses the process of bringing an existing instrument to a wider musical community, including how musician feedback can be used to refine the instrument's design without compromising its identity. As a case study, the article presents the magnetic resonator piano, an electronically augmented acoustic grand piano that uses electromagnets to induce vibrations in the strings. After initial compositions and performances using the instrument, feedback from composers and performers guided refinements to the design, laying the groundwork for a collaborative project in which six composers wrote pieces for the instrument. The pieces exhibited a striking diversity of style and technique, including instrumental techniques never considered by the designer. The project, which culminated in two concert performances, demonstrates how a new instrument can acquire a community of musicians beyond those initially involved.},

For these reasons, cloth simulation has become a popular topic in the computer graphics research community, and competition is constantly increasing. During the last two decades, textile animation and rendering techniques have dramatically improved, especially in the physical behaviour and visual realism areas [1] (see Fig. 1). The interaction modalities with cloth-like deformable surfaces, however, have not followed this evolution. The most widespread methods for handling virtual textiles are traditionally based on the use of a mouse and a keyboard. But the limits imposed by old-fashioned interaction technology decrease many opportunities, as humans, used to skin contact with clothing materials since prehistoric ages, strongly rely on their feeling of touch when handling textiles.},

Humans vary their impedance to reduce contact forces, to increase positional control, and to stabilize unstable dynamics. The neuromuscular system modulates overall limb impedance by strategically selecting appropriate limb configurations and by selective activation of musculature. To date, haptic interfaces neither respond to nor measure these effects. We seek a real-time measurement technique to estimate user impedance, with the hope of enabling variable impedance based control of telerobots and haptic environments. We propose that such a measure might be generated through the introduction of controlled vibrations to the user through a haptic device. A model for such a system and its implications on device design is described. The results of preliminary study using a prototype device are compared to reference measurements of user stiffness and grip force.},

Day [1] reports that only 4.0\% of synaesthetes report coloured touch and 0.8\% report vision-to-touch, compared to 68.8\% reporting coloured graphemes (note: these are percentages of synaesthetes, not percentages of general population). A second reason is that researchers don’t always volunteer it. We made a chance discovery of someone who experiences tactile sensations on her own body when watching someone else being touched as a result of an email request about other forms of synaesthesia. We have since found that other synaesthetes have it too but they didn’t report it until prompted because they considered it ‘normal’ (i.e., they assumed everyone else had it).},

	abstract = {A method for 6-{DOF} haptic rendering of isosurface geometry embedded within sampled volume data is presented. The algorithm uses a quasi-static formulation of motion constrained by multiple contacts to simulate rigid-body interaction between a haptically controlled virtual tool (proxy), represented as a point-sampled surface, and volumetric isosurfaces. Unmodified volume data, such as computed tomography or magnetic resonance images, can be rendered directly with this approach, making it particularly suitable for applications in medical or surgical simulation. The algorithm was implemented and tested on a variety of volume data sets using several virtual tools with different geometry. As the constraint-based algorithm permits simulation of a massless proxy, no artificial mass or inertia were needed nor observed. The speed and transparency of the algorithm allowed motion to be responsive to extremely stiff contacts with complex virtualized geometry. Despite rendering stiffnesses that approach the physical limits of the interfaces used, the simulation remained stable through haptic interactions that typically present a challenge to other rendering methods, including wedging, prying, and hooking.},

The curvature of the texture is encoded in a normal map which allows the computation of the curvature and local changes of orientation, according to the mouse position and direction. A user evaluation was conducted to compare the optically-induced haptic feedback of the curvature-based approach versus the original depth-based approach based on depth maps. Results showed that users, in addition to being able to efficiently recognize simulated bumps and holes with the curvature-based approach, were also able to discriminate shapes with lower frequency and amplitude.},

In spite of a large variety in terms of instrumentation, a bass instrument can be found in most music genres. Thus, the bass track can be analysed to explore stylistic similarities between music genres. We present an extensive set of transcription-based high-level features related to rhythm and tonality that allows one to characterize basslines on a symbolic level. Traditional classification techniques based on pattern recognition techniques and audio features are compared with rule-based classification and classification based on the similarity between basslines. We use a novel dataset that consists of typical basslines of 13 music genres from different cultural backgrounds for evaluation purposes. Finally, the genre confusion results obtained in the experiments are examined by musicologists. Our study shows that several known stylistic relationships between music genres could be verified that way by classifying typical basslines. We could achieve a highest accuracy value of 64.8\% for the genre classification solely based on repetitive basslines of a song.},

	abstract = {Virtual coupling is commonly used to maintain stability of penalty-based haptic rendering. However, due to dozens of design parameters involved in the dynamics and force model, to increase transparency while maintaining stability using virtual coupling remains a challenge for 6-Degree-of-Freedom ({DOF)} haptic rendering. Using an equivalent-angle analysis, we transform 3-{DOF} rotation into 1-{DOF} rotation, thereby transforming the 6-{DOF} dynamics into six 1-{DOF} dynamics. For each 1-{DOF} dynamics, a damped vibration model is proposed to analyze the computation of the `graphic tool'. The equilibrium position/angle is defined to analyze the convergence of numerical integration. With this approach, we can improve the transparency of 6-{DOF} haptic rendering in both free space and constraint space by experimentally determining only two parameters: the integration time step and the number of integrations in each simulation loop. Using this method, we can improve the coupling stiffness to fully exploit the display capability of the haptic device and maintain the stability of the haptic rendering.},

In this work, we present a novel approach that enables the user to imitate the music playing gestures around mobile devices. In our approach, touch-less gestures, which change magnetic field around the device, are employed for interaction. The activity of playing an instrument can be transparently pursued by moving a tiny magnet in hand around new generation of mobile phones equipped with embedded digital compass (magnetic sensor). The phonation intentions of the user can be simulated on the mobile device by capturing the gestural pattern using magnetic sensor. The proposed method allows digital imitation of a broad number of instruments while still being able to sense musical hits and relative plectrum gestures. It provides a framework for extending interaction space with music applications beyond physical boundaries of small mobile devices, and to {3D} space around the device. This can allow for a more natural, comfortable and flexible interaction. We present several mobile music applications developed based on the proposed method for Apple {iPhone} {3GS.}},

	abstract = {Modern digital music libraries contain textual, visual, and audio data. Recall that musical information is represented in diverse data formats which, depending upon the respective application, differ fundamentally in their structure and content. In this chapter, we introduce various synchronization tasks to automatically link different data streams given various formats (score, {MIDI}, audio) that represent the same piece of music (Sect. 5.1). Particularly, two different synchronization procedures are described in detail. First, we present an efficient and robust multiscale {DTW} approach for time-aligning two different {CD} recordings of the same piece (Sect. 5.2). Using chroma-based audio features, our algorithm yields good synchronization results for harmony-based music at a reasonable resolution level that is sufficient in view of music retrieval and navigation applications. Second, we discuss an algorithm for score- audio synchronization, which aligns the musical onset times given by a score with their physical occurrences a {CD} recording of the same piece (Sect. 5.3). Using semantically meaningful onset features, this algorithm works particularly well for piano music and yields alignments at a high temporal resolution. In Sect. 5.4, we describe possible research directions, give further references to the literature, and discuss some problems related to music synchronization. The first three sections of this chapter closely follow [5], [142], and [141], respectively.},

	abstract = {High-frequency vibrations are an essential part of numerous manipulation tasks. A promising research area, in particular, are telemanipulation tasks where vibrations occurring in the remote environment are fed back through tactile displays. Three experiments concerning the perception of vibrations were conducted. The first experiment aims at determining whether vibrations are coded primarily by frequency, amplitude, or acceleration by human participants. Results show that primarily frequency and amplitude, but not acceleration of the vibrations were perceived. In the second experiment, participants’ just noticeable difference ({JND)} for frequency under different conditions was examined. The resulting {JND} of 18\% for frequencies showed dependence neither on the amplitude or acceleration, which were independently held constant, nor on the reference frequencies. Therefore, it is not necessary to adjust the subjective intensity for vibrations for each human operator when designing and using tactile displays. In the third experiment, the stimuli and the procedure of the second experiment were replicated using different configurations and a mere force-output device. The resulting {JNDs} were 21\% for vibrations of 100 Hz, and 17\% for vibrations of 150 Hz and above. Furthermore, there was no visual dominance over the haptic modality regarding the {JND} for frequencies.},

The thermal diffusivity of a material is a parameter that controls the rate with which heat is extracted from the hand when it touches an object of that material. This rate of heat extraction is an important cue for distinguishing materials and recognising objects by means of touch. We have measured the ability of human observers to discriminate between different rates of heat extraction. This was done using a device that displayed different transient temperature profiles to the finger. In different conditions, subjects were repeatedly asked to select the faster-cooling of two stimuli. The discrimination threshold was around 43\% of the extraction rate. A rate that was twice as slow also yielded twice the absolute discrimination threshold. When we halved the temperature difference between beginning and end of the stimulus, the threshold did not change as much. This shows that subjects can use the rate of heat extraction as a cue and that they can discriminate between materials if their thermal diffusivities are at least 43\% apart.},

Application based or task specific evaluation methods have been proposed to test haptic interfaces during their proper use. This approach requires a human user to perform the task, thus it involves human dynamic and intention uncertainties. Although there is a variety of task specific evaluation approaches for haptic interfaces, it has not yet been possible to define a norm for meaningful device comparison and assessment. A proper evaluation procedure for haptic interfaces should link device performance measures to the limits of human perception in order to obtain device-specific limits. This chapter deals with psychophysical evaluation methodology. Testbed evaluation approach is applied to haptic interactions and a set of benchmark metrics are provided for haptic interfaces. We describe the methodology of seven testbeds and experimentally demonstrate usefulness of the testbeds on three commercial force-feedback devices. Finally, the general discussion at the end of this chapter summarizes the outcomes of the proposed psychophysical evaluation methodology.},

Major determinants are development and aging as well as alterations following injury and compensatory brain reorganization. While during early development haptic perception is refined due to maturation and experience, haptic perception during aging deteriorates due to many factors, not all of them fully understood. Besides these lifespan factors, it is common wisdom that haptic perception and skills in general improve through practice (Fig. 1), see also [1]. Perceptual learning involves relatively long-lasting changes to an organism’s perceptual system that improve its ability to respond to its environment and are caused by this environment. In case of Blinds or in Musicians, both characterized by superior haptic perception, improvement is assumed to be due to use-dependent or experience-dependent neuroplasticity mechanisms.},

To this end, novel features are proposed and evaluated on the basis of musical knowledge, in this article—a total of 13 feature groups based on chromatic representation include scales, chords, major and minor Probe Tone Ratings, and further derived variations. We present extensive results on a database containing 35 h of originally recorded music covering diverse genres as popular, classical, and Jazz music. In the pre-processing, adjustment of reference pitch classes, {dB(A)-weighting}, band-pass-filter type selection, frequency selection, and gating time are discussed in detail. In addition to traditional correlation-based approaches we employ a data-driven model using Support Vector Machines. Overall, the proposed features enhance correlation results and their combination boosts data-driven audio key determination accuracy. The latter approach based on learnt models significantly outperforms correlation-based determination by 5.0\% and 6.7\% absolute for the determination of 12 and 24 major and minor keys (clustered or separately), respectively. Maximum accuracy reaches 77.3\% and 62.1\% for these 12 or 24 keys over the diverse recordings.},

	abstract = {Abstract This paper describes a system for accommodating active listening for persons with hearing aids or cochlear implants, with a special focus on children at an early stage of cognitive development and with additional physical disabilities. A system called the Soundscraper is proposed and consists of a software part in Pure data and a hardware part using an Arduino microcontroller with a combination of sensors. For both the software and hardware development it was important to always ensure that the system was flexible enough to cater for the very different conditions that are characteristic of the intended user group. The Soundscraper has been tested with 25 children with good results. An increased attention span was reported, as well as positively surprising reactions from children where the caregivers were unsure whether they could hear at all. The sound synthesis methods, the gesture sensors and the employed parameter mapping were all simple, but they provided a controllable and sufficiently complex sound environment even with limited interaction. A possible future outcome of the application is the adoption of long-time analysis of sound preferences as opposed to traditional audiological investigations.},

Old neuropsychological findings from different groups of patients and more recent laboratory studies are in agreement about the major memory systems in the human brain. A distinction is made between declarative or explicit memory and nondeclarative or implicit memory. Of special interest is the distinction in declarative memory between episodic and semantic memory [1]. Episodic memory includes personal experiences and conscious recollection of events in our past. This type of memory is defined by the capacity to retrieve voluntarily facts and events in the spatial-temporal context. On the other hand, semantic memory refers to our general knowledge, including the meaning of words and concepts.},

Melodic similarity has been studied by a number of means, sometimes quite contrasting, which lead to important differences in the light of the finding that similarity is dependent on context. Models of melodic similarity based on reduction show that the existence of multiple possible reductions forms a natural basis for similarity to depend on interpretation. Examination of the {MIREX} 2005 data shows wide variations in subjects' judgements of melodic similarity and some evidence that the perceived similarity between two melodies can be influenced by the presence of a third melody. Examples from Mozart suggest that he deliberately exploited the possibilities inherent in recognizing similarity through different interpretations. It is therefore proposed that similarity be thought of not as a distinct and definite function of two melodies but as something created in the minds of those who hear the melodies.},

	abstract = {Given a class of semantically related motions, we have derived a class motion template that captures the consistent as well as the inconsistent aspects of all motions in the class. The application of {MTs} to automatic motion annotation and retrieval, which is the content of this chapter, is based on the following interpretation: the consistent aspects of a class {MT} represent the class characteristics that are shared by all motions, whereas the inconsistent aspects represent the class variations that are due to different realizations. The key idea in designing a distance measure for comparing a class {MT} with unknown motion data is to mask out the inconsistent aspects – a kind of class-dependent adaptive feature selection – so that related motions can be identified even in the presence of significant spatio-temporal variations. In Sect. 14.1, we define such a distance measure, which is based on a subsequence variant of {DTW.} Our concepts of {MT-based} annotation and retrieval are then described in Sect. 14.2 and Sect. 14.3, respectively, where we also report on our extensive experiments [143, 144]. To substantially speed up the annotation and retrieval process, we introduce an index-based (the index being independent of the class {MTs)} preprocessing step to cut down the set of candidate motions by using suitable keyframes (Sect. 14.4). In Sect. 14.5, we compare {MT-based} matching to several baseline methods (based on numerical features) as well as to adaptive fuzzy querying. Finally, related work and future research directions are discussed Sect. 14.6.},

	title = {Inverse piano technique for studying finger interaction during pressing tasks},
	doi = {10.1109/WHC.2009.4810806},
	abstract = {When a person moves or presses with an individual finger other fingers also produce a force (Kilbreath and Gandevia 1994; Li et al. 2004; Zatsiorsky et al. 2000). Several factors are known to contribute to this response: (1) peripheral mechanical coupling, (2) multi-digit motor units, and (3) diverging central commands. This phenomenon, known as enslaving, has traditionally been studied in isometric pressing tasks. The purpose of this project was to build a device, an Inverse Piano ({IP)}, to study finger interaction in non-isometric pressing tasks. The {IP} allows for fingers to be unexpectedly raised or lowered during pressing tasks. Fingers are perturbed by linear motors located directly under uni-dimensional force sensors, which serve as the "piano keys". Motors are triggered using National Instruments Lab {VIEW.} This allows key position and finger force data to be recorded simultaneously. The {IP} makes possible the studying of several factors on the finger force outcome and coordination. In particular, the following factors can be explored: (a) Finger combination. There are 15 combinations of the key manipulation: four 1-finger tasks (I, M, R, L, where the letters designate the index, middle, ring, and little finger respectively); six 2-finger tasks ({IM}, {IR}, {IL}, {MR}, {ML}, {RL);} four 3-finger tasks ({IMR}, {IML}, {IRL}, {MRL)} and one 4-finger task ({IMRL).} (b) Predictability of the key raising. The options are innumerable but can be roughly classified into three groups: (1) both the sequence and time intervals are unknown to the subjects; (2) the sequence is known but the time intervals are unknown; and (3) both the sequence and time intervals are known in advance, (c) Amplitude of key movement. The {IP} is capable of displacing fingers up to 2 cm, in increments less than 1 mm. (d) The speed of key movement. The {IP} can vary key movement rates of between 2 mm/s to 4,687 mm/s. (e) Resistance of the keys to the external force. The resistance can mimic different mechanical properties,- - e.g. elastic resistance which is proportional to the key displacement, damping resistance proportional to the speed, dry friction, etc. The magnitude of the resistance, e.g. 'stiffness', can also be varied, (f) Feedback with various options: (1) visual feedback on the computer screen, the subject can also see his/her hand; (2) no visual feedback on the screen, however the subject can see his/her hand; and (3) no feedback on the screen, the subject cannot see his/her hand. Thus far experimentation using {IP} has only investigated effects of varying magnitude of displacement. The {IP} also has the potential to be utilized as a rehabilitation device for patients suffering a loss of dexterity and finger strength. It is possible for a variety of programs to be created that would train both finger independence and strength. One such program is illustrated in figure 1 where a target force is given on a computer screen and the patient would be instructed to match the force output of their instructed finger(s) to the target. The {IP} would also make it possible to give very precise quantitative feedback, on various measures of performance, to the clinician as opposed to qualitative feedback that is the staple of most current methods of rehabilitation. The purpose of the demonstration is to show the capabilities of the {IP} as both a research and rehabilitation device. Several custom programs will be written that allow for easy manipulation of variables (i.e. key height, speed of raising, combination of keys raised, target force feedback, etc) so that attendees, with both research and clinician backgrounds, can test the {IP.}},

	abstract = {Even though there is a rapidly growing corpus of motion capture data, there still is a lack of efficient motion retrieval systems that allow to identify and extract user-specified motions. Previous retrieval systems often require manually generated textual annotations, which roughly describe the motions in words. Since the manual generation of reliable and descriptive labels is infeasible for large datasets, one needs efficient content-based retrieval methods that only access the raw data itself. In this context, the query-by-example ({QBE)} paradigm has attracted a large amount of attention: given a query in form of a motion fragment, the task is to automatically retrieve all motion clips from the database containing parts or aspects similar to the query. The crucial point in such an approach is the notion of similarity used to compare the query with the database motions. For the motion scenario, two motions may be regarded as similar if they represent variations of the same action or sequence of actions. These variations may concern the spatial as well as the temporal domain. For example, the two jumps shown in Fig. 11.1 describe the same kind of motion, even though they differ considerably with respect to timing, intensity, and execution style (note, e.g., the arm swing). Similarly, the kicks shown in Fig. 1.1 describe the same kind of motion, even though they differ considerably with respect to direction and height of the kick. In other words, semantically similar motions need not be numerically similar, as is also pointed out in [107].},

The system comprises of an array of small vibrating motors and a control box that supplies power to and provides a control interface for up to twelve motors through the parallel port of a standard personal computer. The vibrotactile array can be fastened along the forearm, arm, thigh, leg or abdomen in any configuration using Velcro and fabric wraps. All motors are operated in a binary fashion, i.e. on or off, with quick response time and perceivable vibration magnitudes. The {tRMS} system is inexpensive and portable, providing spatiotemporal variations in tactile cues to regulate respiratory motion during radiotherapy. The system will also be used in future psychophysical studies to determine effective use of tactile cues to control human motor actions.},

This paper presents a methodological approach for collecting and analyzing haptic expressions of emotions. We compare three statistical methods, namely analysis of variance, principal component analysis, and clustering.

Real-time evaluation of distributed contact forces between rigid or deformable {3D} objects is a key ingredient of 6-{DoF} force-feedback rendering. We demonstrate a spatially and temporally adaptive approach to approximate distributed contact forces under hard real-time constraints. Our method is {CPU} based, and supports contact between rigid or reduced deformable models with complex geometry. We propose a contact model that uses a point-based representation for one object, and a signed-distance field for the other. This model is related to the Voxmap pointshell method ({VPS)}, but gives continuous contact forces and torques, enabling stable rendering of stiff penalty-based distributed contacts.},

	abstract = {In recent years, many tactile sensors have been developed for the practical use in robotics and to meet the increasing demand for intuitive interfaces. However, the implementation of conventional tactile sensors is very complex. We develop a simple total-internal-reflection based tactile sensor that measures the shape of the sensor surface from a reflection image of the surface and evaluate its performance. We previously proposed a reconstruction method which solves geometric optical constraints of the sensor surface by optimization, however this method could not meet real-time and accurate reconstruction simultaneously. To solve this problem, in this paper, we propose a new reconstruction method based on the previously proposed one. By reconstruction experiments with simulated reflection images, we found that the proposed method could perform real-time and accurate reconstruction and was applicable to various sensor shapes and robust to feature tracking error and the presence of contact areas on the sensor surface without total-internal-reflection property. Then, we implemented the proposed method on the actual sensor and confirmed that the sensor could perform real-time reconstruction.},

	abstract = {The alignments and crosslinks obtained from audio synchronization (Chap. 5) and audio matching (Chap. 6) can be used to conveniently switch between different versions of a piece of music (interdocument navigation). We will now address the problem of audio structure analysis, which lays the basis for intradocument navigation. One major goal of the structural analysis of an audio recording is to automatically extract the repetitive structure or, more generally, the musical form of the underlying piece of music. Recent approaches such as [14,37,46,49,81,127,129,139,161]work well for music where the repetitions largely agree with respect to instrumentation and tempo as it is typically the case for popular music. For other classes of music including Western classical music, however, musically similar audio segments may exhibit significant variations in parameters such as dynamics, timbre, execution of note groups, musical key, articulation, and tempo progression. In this chapter, we propose robust and efficient algorithms for structure analysis that identifies musically similar segments. To obtain a flexible and robust algorithm, the idea is to simultaneously account for possible variations at various stages and levels. At the feature level, we use coarse chroma-based audio features that absorb microvariations. To cope with local variations, we design an advanced cost measure by integrating contextual information (Sect. 7.2). Finally, we describe a new strategy for structure extraction that can cope with more global variations (Sects. 7.3 and 7.4). Our experimental results with classical and popular music show that our algorithm performs successfully even in the presence of significant musical variations (Sect. 7.5). In Sect. 7.1, we start by summarizing a general strategy for audio structure analysis and introduce some notation that is used throughout this chapter. Related work and future research directions will be discussed in Sect. 7.6. In this chapter, we closely follow [139]. The enhancement strategy of self-similarity matrices by introducing a contextual local cost measure has first been described in [137].},

	abstract = {An experiment has been made, in which participants grasping the stylus of a robotic arm were physically guided along a jagged or rounded trajectory, and then were asked to associate either trajectory to the word “takete” or “maluma”. A significant preference (nine out of eleven participants) for associating the jagged trajectory to “takete” and the rounded trajectory to “maluma” has been found, indicating the existence of a connectivity between haptic trajectories and words. This result suggests to interaction designers to avoid the association of counter-intuitive labels or verbal meanings to (yet rarely used) structured synthetic kinesthetic messages (“haptons”) that are perceived as jagged or rounded. The experiment complements existing research on cross-modal associations between stimuli belonging to other sensory channels, such as vision or taste, and words having demonstrated verbal equivalence to “takete” and “maluma”. Furthermore, it raises interest on currently unanswered questions about the perceptual importance of temporal aspects in the haptic recognition of shapes by rectilinear or curvilinear contour patterns, and their higher-level decoding and connectivity at cortical level.},

	abstract = {Recent advances in cognitive science and cognitive neuroscience open up new vistas for human enhancement. Central to much of this work is the idea of new human-machine interfaces (in general) and new brain-machine interfaces (in particular). But despite the increasing prominence of such ideas, the very idea of such an interface remains surprisingly under-explored. In particular, the notion of human enhancement suggests an image of the embodied and reasoning agent as literally extended or augmented, rather than the more conservative image of a standard (non-enhanced) agent using a tool via some new interface. In this essay, I explore this difference, and attempt to lay out some of the conditions under which the more radical reading (positing brand new integrated agents or systemic wholes) becomes justified. I adduce some empirical evidence suggesting that the radical result is well within our scientific reach. The main reason why this is so has less to do with the advancement of our science (though that certainly helps) than with our native biological plasticity. We humans, I shall try to show, are biologically disposed towards literal (and repeated) episodes of sensory re-calibration, of bodily re-configuration and of mental extension. Such potential for literal and repeated re-configuration is the mark of what I shall call “profoundly embodied agency,” contrasting it with a variety of weaker (less philosophically and scientifically interesting) understandings of the nature and importance of embodiment for minds and persons. The article ends by relating the image of profound embodiment to some questions (and fears) concerning converging technologies for improving human performance.},

In this study we proposed a new curvature perception haptic device that can independently orient, elevate and translate a flat plate.

According to the characteristics of this device, two curvature rendering motion models were analyzed: motion model without compensation and motion model with position compensation. Two experiments were then executed. Experiment 1 has verified that our device is able to produce distinct curvatures. Experiment 2 has compared the performances obtained with each motion model during the tasks of curved shape discrimination.},

We may sense how rough or smooth a surface is, or how curved an object is, whether it is soft or hard, whether the surface is slippery or sticky, how heavy it is and so on. Less obvious, but equally important, is the use the motor control system makes of these sensory signals in order to ensure appropriate hand movements resulting in stable grasps and effective complex manipulations. Some examples of common manipulations in our daily lives are: lifting a cup of coffee, opening a door, getting dressed, typing a manuscript, threading a needle.},

	abstract = {In this work we present {PhyNeSS} - a novel physics-driven neural networks-based surgical simulation system which, for the first time, combines the complexity and accuracy of physics-based non-linear soft tissue models and commercial finite element codes with the high speed of execution of machine learned neural networks. While soft tissue is inherently nonlinear, physics-based simulation of nonlinear tissue behavior with haptic feedback is very challenging as the solution of the coupled nonlinear partial differential equations is iterative and therefore extremely computationally intensive. The major contribution of this paper is that through an unprecedented combination of hard and soft computing methods, it is able to reduce the solution of nonlinear problems to almost the same complexity as solving linear problems. This promises to resolve one of the longest-standing technical challenges of real time surgical simulation. The first phase of the method is a pre-computation phase, in which each node of the organ model, with known linear or nonlinear material properties, is provided with carefully chosen prescribed displacements and the response, computed using commercial finite element software tools, is recorded off-line and stored in a large database. The data in then vastly condensed into a set of coefficients describing neurons of a radial basis function ({RBF)} networks or easier storage and rapid reproduction. During real-time computations, as the surgical tool interacts with the organ models, these neural networks are used to reconstruct the deformation fields as well as the reaction forces at the surgical tool tip. We present simulation results for realistic surgical scenarios with real time force feedback.},

The precise segmentation of a music piece at instances where key changes occur allows for further analysis, like self-similarity analysis, chord recognition, and several other techniques that mainly pertain to the characterization of music content. This article examines the automatic segmentation of audio data into parts composed in different keys, using clustering on chroma-related spaces. To this end, the k-means algorithm is used and a methodology is proposed so that useful information about key changes can be derived, regardless of the number of clusters or key changes. The proposed methodology is evaluated by experimenting on the segmentation of recordings of existing compositions from the Classic-Romantic repertoire. Additional analysis is performed using artificial data sets. Specifically, the construction of artificial pieces is proposed as a means to investigate the potential of the strategy under discussion in predefined key-change scenarios that encompass different musical characteristics. For the existing compositions, we compare the results of our proposed methodology with others from the music information retrieval literature. Finally, although the proposed methodology is only capable of locating key changes and not the key identities themselves, we discuss results regarding the labeling of a composition's key in the located segments.},

Here, we examine the extent to which the responses of a computational model of neural resonance relate to the range of tapping behaviours associated with human polyrhythm perception. The principal findings of the tests suggest that: (a) the model is able to mirror all the different modes of human tapping behaviour, for reasonably justified settings and (b) the non-linear resonance feature of the model has clear advantages over linear oscillator models in addressing human tapping behaviours related to polyrhythm perception.},

Central to this process are human user studies in which the displays are evaluated in terms of their capacity to present information to users and the sensitivity of the user to changes in display parameters. A variety of psychophysical procedures are employed for this purpose, most of which have been adapted from research on the visual and auditory systems. The sensory systems involved in processing haptic information present unique challenges due to the active nature of sensory exploration and these need to be taken into account in designing psychophysical experiments with tactile and haptic displays. In this half-day tutorial we will give an overview of psychophysical methods that can be used to analyze haptic perception, including those associated with measuring thresholds, information transfer and multi-dimensional scaling. We will also consider how these methods should be employed in the context of studying novel tactile and haptic illusions.},

	abstract = {This paper focuses on the construction of a novel belt tactile interface and telepresence system intended for mobile robot control. The robotic system consists of a mobile robot and a wearable master robot. The elaborated algorithms allow the robot to precisely recognize the shape, boundaries, movement direction, speed, and distance to the obstacle by means of the laser range finders. The designed tactile belt interface receives the detected information and maps it through the vibrotactile patterns. We designed the patterns in such a way that they convey the obstacle parameters in a very intuitive, robust, and unobtrusive manner. The robot movement direction and speed are governed by the tilt of the user's torso. The sensors embedded into the belt interface measure the user orientation and gestures precisely. Such an interface lets to deeply engage the user into the teleoperation process and to deliver them the tactile perception of the remote environment at the same time. The key point is that the user gets the opportunity to use own arms, hands, fingers for operation of the robotic manipulators and another devices installed on the mobile robot platform. The experimental results of user study revealed the effectiveness of the designed vibration patterns for obstacle parameter presentation. The accuracy in 100\% for detection of the moving object by participants was achieved. We believe that the developed robotic system has significant potential in facilitating the navigation of mobile robot while providing a high degree of immersion into remote space.},

This interactive music system introduces a musical experience in which the musician creates a digital painting by playing an acoustic musical instrument and by moving the body on a coloured pressure mat. As a learning tool it aims at the development of musical creativity, at the stimulation of embodied understanding of music and at the development of an intimate relationship with the musical instrument. First, the methodological approach is outlined and pedagogical and theoretical backgrounds are discussed. Then, we report on an experiment in which 51 amateur musicians participated. The experiment aimed at probing the application's potential to induce a flow experience and to learn about how participants evaluate the didactic relevance of the Music Paint Machine. Results suggest that the Music Paint Machine has the potential to evoke a flow experience. Furthermore participants acknowledged its didactic relevance with regard to learning to improvise, to developing understanding of musical parameters and to stimulating creativity.},

In addition, a ferro-fluidic sealing technique was developed to prevent the fluid from leaking and to reduce off-state friction. Experimental results showed that, when compared to a commercial {MR} brake, our 33\% smaller prototype {MR-brake} could generate 2.7 times more torque (10.9 Nm). A 1-{DOF} haptic interface employing the brake enabled crisp virtual wall collision simulations. Significant reduction in the off-state torque was obtained by applying a reverse current pulse to collapse a residual magnetic field in the brake.},

	abstract = {This paper describes the {"Soundbeam} {MIDI} (Musical Instrument Digital Interface) Controller," which allows even those students who have severe physical disabilities to create interesting aural and musical effects. Soundbeam works by emitting an invisible beam of high frequency sound inaudible to human ears. Even very slight interruptions of and movements within the beam change digital data about the beam's speed and direction. These data can be interpreted by a wide range of electronic musical instruments. The paper notes that this technology is being used in more than 1,000 special education and adult centers in over 20 countries and describes the development of the Soundbeam Project as a partnership between professionals in special education, music composition, electronics, and psychology. The paper explains the operation and performance of the equipment as well as a continuum of possible applications, ranging from the basics of cause-and-effect effect work and "sound therapy" to more ambitious creative/performance applications. Uses of the technology are seen as developing skills such as aesthetic awareness, imagination, listening skills, motor planning skills, memory skills, language skills, and social skills.

	abstract = {Active touch is often described as yielding “better-quality” information than passive touch. However, some authors have argued that passive-guided movements generate superior percepts due to a reduction in demands on the haptic sensory system. We consider the possibility that passive-guided conditions, as used in most active-passive comparisons, are relatively free from cognitive decision-making, while active conditions involve cognitive loads that are quite high and uncharacteristic of normal sensory processes. Thus studies that purport to show differences in active and passive touch may instead be revealing differences in the amount of cognition involved in active and passive tasks. We hypothesized that passive-guided conditions reduce not the sensory load but the cognitive load that active explorers must bear. To test this hypothesis Blood Oxygen Level Dependent ({BOLD)} activity was measured using functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ({fMRI)} during active and passive-guided fingertip exploration of {2D} raised line drawings. Active movements resulted in greater activation (compared with passive movements) in areas implicated in higher order processes such as monitoring and controlling of goal-directed behavior, attention, execution of movements, and error detection. Passive movements, in contrast, produced greater {BOLD} activity in areas associated with touch perception, length discrimination, tactile object recognition, and efference copy. The activation of a greater number of higher-order processing areas during active relative to passive-guided exploration suggests that instances of passive-guided superiority may not be due to the haptic system’s limited ability to cope with sensory inputs, but rather the restriction imposed by the use of a single finger such that active exploration may require cognitive strategies not demanded in the passive condition. Our findings suggest that previous attempts to compare active and passive touch have, in order to simplify tasks, inadvertently introduced cognitive load at the expense of normal sensory inputs.},

This novel approach is illustrated within a proof-of-concept system: haptic guides are toggled during a path-following task thanks to a mental workload index provided by a {BCI.} The aim of this system is to provide haptic assistance only when the user’s brain activity reflects a high mental workload. A user study conducted with 8 participants shows that our proof-of-concept is operational and exploitable. Results show that activation of haptic guides occurs in the most difficult part of the path-following task. Moreover it allows to increase task performance by 53\% by activating assistance only 59\% of the time. Taken together, these results suggest that {BCI} could be used to determine when the user needs assistance during haptic interaction and to enable haptic guides accordingly.},

While closely-spaced high-frequency vibrotactile actuators can be difficult to distinguish, our system utilized four linear {DC} motors for presenting spatial tactile messages through low-frequency actuation. An experiment was conducted to determine accuracy for recognizing stimuli presented on the palm of the hand. Participants were asked to identify 10 predefined stimulus patterns created from the four linear actuators positioned in either a diamond or square configuration. Results showed that positional, linear, and circular stimuli were recognized with mean response accuracies of 98.8, 96.5, and 90.2\%, respectively. No statistically significant differences were found between the actuator configurations. These findings can be utilized in developing a remote communication channel that supports the transfer of spatial aspects of touch such as mapping the location of finger touch of one user to tactile sensation on the palm of another user.},

In this essay it is argued that motion is central to our understanding of many aspects of music, particularly to our understanding of rhythm, and that an adequate account of motion in music requires a neurobiological perspective. Two possible mechanisms are discussed that may form a neurobiological basis for the association of motion in music: a vestibulomotor mechanism and an audio-visuo-motor mechanism. These two mechanisms in turn may mediate two distinct kinds of musical motion: gesture and locomotion.},

	abstract = {We present libmapper, a software library and protocol for providing network-enabled discovery and connectivity of real-time control signals. Today there is a trade-off present in the state of the art for music-related networking. At one extreme, we have many systems still using {MIDI}, an old and insufficient standard for specifying keyboard-oriented commands embedded in short, coded 3-byte messages, limiting modulation controls to a 7-bit range. At the other extreme we have Open Sound Control ({OSC)} [7], a flexible packet format that supports named data and a wide number of binary numerical representations, but lacks built-in semantic standards. The present work proposes a semantic layer built on {OSC} over multicast {UDP/IP} used to carry metadata about signals, which can specify peer-to-peer connectivity between nodes along with instructions for associated translation of data representations. The translation layer avoids the need for normalization or standardization of data representation while maintaining ease of use and providing a distributed, flexible approach to music networking. The goal is to provide a system for fast and dynamic experimentation during the mapping phase of instrument design.},

	abstract = {Humans can detect and discriminate between fine variations of surface roughness using active touch. It is hitherto believed that roughness perception is mediated mostly by cutaneous and subcutaneous afferents located in the fingertips. However, recent findings have shown that following abolishment of cutaneous afferences resulting from trauma or pharmacological intervention, the ability of subjects to discriminate between textures roughness was not significantly altered. These findings suggest that the somatosensory system is able to collect textural information from other sources than fingertip afference. It follows that signals resulting of the interaction of a finger with a rough surface must be transmitted to stimulate receptor populations in regions far away from the contact. This transmission was characterized by measuring in the wrist vibrations originating at the fingertip and thus propagating through the finger, the hand and the wrist during active exploration of textured surfaces. The spectral analysis of the vibrations taking place in the forearm tissues revealed regularities that were correlated with the scanned surface and the speed of exploration. In the case of periodic textures, the vibration signal contained a fundamental frequency component corresponding to the finger velocity divided by the spatial period of the stimulus. This regularity was found for a wide range of textural length scales and scanning velocities. For non-periodic textures, the spectrum of the vibration did not contain obvious features that would enable discrimination between the different stimuli. However, for both periodic and non-periodic stimuli, the intensity of the vibrations could be related to the microgeometry of the scanned surfaces.},

Although catheters allow for the delivery of fluids and drugs, the deployment of devices, and the acquisition of the measurements, they do not allow clinicians to assess the physical properties of tissue inside the body due to the tissue motion and transmission limitations of the catheter devices, including compliance, friction, and backlash. The goal of this research is to increase the tactile information available to physicians during catheter procedures by providing haptic feedback during palpation procedures. To accomplish this goal, we have developed the first motion compensated actuated catheter system that enables haptic perception of fast moving tissue structures. The actuated catheter is instrumented with a distal tip force sensor and a force feedback interface that allows users to adjust the position of the catheter while experiencing the forces on the catheter tip. The efficacy of this device and interface is evaluated through a psychophyisical study comparing how accurately users can differentiate various materials attached to a cardiac motion simulator using the haptic device and a conventional manual catheter. The results demonstrate that haptics improves a user's ability to differentiate material properties and decreases the total number of errors by 50\% over the manual catheter system.},

	abstract = {A variety of tasks could benefit from the availability of direction cues that do not rely on vision or sound. Skin stretch has been found to be a reliable means of communicating direction and has potential to be rendered by a compact device. We have conducted experiments exploring the use of lateral skin stretch at the fingertip to communicate direction. A small rubber cylinder was pressed against a subject's fingertip and moved at constant speed to stretch the skin of the fingerpad. The skin was stretched with a range of displacements (0.05 mm-1 mm) and speeds (0.5 mm/s-4 mm/s). Subjects were asked to respond with the direction of the skin stretch, choosing from 4 directions, each separated by 90 degrees. It was found that subjects could perceive skin stretch direction with as little as 0.05 mm of stretch. Direction detection accuracy was found to be dependent upon both the speed and total displacement of the skin stretch. Higher speeds and larger displacements resulted in greater accuracy. High accuracy rates, greater than 95\%, were observed with as little as 0.2 mm of skin stretch and at speeds as slow as 2 mm/s. Accuracy was also found to vary with the direction of the stimulus. This preliminary information will be used to inform the design of a miniature tactile display suitable for use in hand-held electronics.},

	abstract = {Data-driven haptic rendering requires processing of raw recorded signals, which leads to high computational effort for large datasets. To achieve real-time performance, one possibility is to reduce the parameter space of the employed interpolation technique, which generally decreases the accuracy in the rendering. In this paper, we propose a method for guiding this parameter reduction to maintain high accuracy with respect to the just noticeable difference for forces. To this end, we performed a user study to estimate this perception threshold. The threshold is used to assess the final error in the rendered forces as well as for the parameter reduction process. Comparison with measured data from real object interactions confirms the accuracy of our method and highlights the reduced computational effort.},

	abstract = {Automatic music processing poses a number of challenging questions because of the complexity and diversity of music data. As discussed in Sect. 2.1, one generally has to account for various aspects such as the data format (e.g., score, {MIDI}, audio), the instrumentation (e.g., orchestra, piano, drums, voice), and many other parameters such as articulation, dynamics, or tempo. To make music data comparable and algorithmically accessible, the first step in all music processing tasks is to extract suitable features that capture relevant key aspects while suppressing irrelevant details or variations. Here, the notion of similarity is of crucial importance in the design of audio features. In some applications and particularly in the case in music retrieval, one may be interested in characterizing an audio recording irrespective of certain details concerning the interpretation or instrumentation. Conversely, other applications may be concerned with measuring just the niceties that relate to a musician’s individual articulation or emotional expressiveness.},

Unlike the existing approaches, friction rendering does not rely on the algorithms introduced for polyhedral surfaces. Our algorithm implements the stiction model of friction for haptic rendering by utilizing a feedback-stabilized closest point tracking algorithm developed for parametric surfaces. Therefore, our friction rendering algorithm is inherently stable and it can handle surfaces with high curvature. Furthermore, it allows for transitions from sticking to sliding and sliding to sticking, as well as surface to surface transitions, without introducing discontinuous force artifacts. Our algorithm allows for tuning of the friction coefficient during the mode transitions to enable rendering of the Stribeck effect. Thanks to its feedback-stabilized core, it is robust against drift and numerical noise. The algorithm is computationally efficient; its applicability and effectiveness to simulate friction is verified through real-time implementations.},

The laser beams, which are made visible by a thin layer of theatrical mist, provide visual feedback and guidance to the performer to alleviate the difficulties of using a non-contact interface as well as adding an interesting component for the audience to observe. The system uses capacitive sensing to detect the proximity of the player's hands; this distance is mapped to pitch, volume, or other continuous effect. The laser guide positions are calibrated before play with position-controlled servo motors interfaced to a main controller board; the location of each beam corresponds to the position where the performer should move his or her hand to achieve a pre-specified pitch and/or effect. The optical system senses the distance of the player's hands from the source of each laser beam, providing an additional dimension of musical control.},

When we take a bite of the fruit, we taste its characteristic flavour and hear a slight smacking sound which confirms that the fruit we perceive with our senses of vision, touch, audition, smell and taste is a ripe, delicious peach. That is, in the natural environment the information delivered by our sense of touch is combined with information gathered by each of the other senses to create a robust percept. Combining information from multiple systems is essential because no information-processing system, neither technical nor biological, is powerful enough to provide a precise and accurate sensory estimate under all conditions.},

	abstract = {Modern digital music libraries contain textual, visual, and audio data. Recall that musical information is represented in diverse data formats which, depending upon the respective application, differ fundamentally in their structure and content. In this chapter, we introduce various synchronization tasks to automatically link different data streams given various formats (score, {MIDI}, audio) that represent the same piece of music (Sect. 5.1). Particularly, two different synchronization procedures are described in detail. First, we present an efficient and robust multiscale {DTW} approach for time-aligning two different {CD} recordings of the same piece (Sect. 5.2). Using chroma-based audio features, our algorithm yields good synchronization results for harmony-based music at a reasonable resolution level that is sufficient in view of music retrieval and navigation applications. Second, we discuss an algorithm for score- audio synchronization, which aligns the musical onset times given by a score with their physical occurrences a {CD} recording of the same piece (Sect. 5.3). Using semantically meaningful onset features, this algorithm works particularly well for piano music and yields alignments at a high temporal resolution. In Sect. 5.4, we describe possible research directions, give further references to the literature, and discuss some problems related to music synchronization. The first three sections of this chapter closely follow [5], [142], and [141], respectively.},

	abstract = {Physical tactile diagrams have traditionally been available to make visual 2-D graphics accessible to individuals who are blind and visually impaired. However, the methods used have drawbacks for which dynamic haptic matrix display devices have been developed to overcome. As texture is a key component of many tactile diagrams, this study examined the psychophysical response of perceived roughness when square wave gratings were explored with a haptic matrix display by blind and sighted participants. Ridge width, groove width, and contact area were all found to be significant factors contributing to the sensation of roughness. When ridge width was held constant, perceived roughness was a decreasing and approximately linear function of groove width. With groove width held constant, however, perceived roughness was found to be an inverted U-shaped quadratic function of ridge width. The magnitude of the sensation of roughness was found to increase when contact area was increased. Finally, no difference was found between the performance of blind and sighted participants. The resulting information has implications for the effective creation of distinct textures using haptic matrix displays for virtual environments and tactile diagrams.},

	abstract = {The use of multiple unmanned aerial vehicles ({UAVs)} is increasingly being incorporated into a wide range of teleoperation applications. To date, relevant research has largely been focused on the development of appropriate control schemes. In this paper, we extend previous research by investigating how control performance could be improved by providing the teleoperator with haptic feedback cues. First, we describe a control scheme that allows a teleoperator to manipulate the flight of multiple {UAVs} in a remote environment. Next, we present three designs of haptic cue feedback that could increase the teleoperator's environmental awareness of such a remote environment. These cues are based on the {UAVs'} i) velocity information, ii) proximity to obstacles, and iii) a combination of these two sources of information. Finally, we present an experimental evaluation of these haptic cue designs. Our evaluation is based on the teleoperator's perceptual sensitivity to the physical environment inhabited by the multiple {UAVs.} We conclude that a teleoperator's perceptual sensitivity is best served by haptic feedback cues that are based on the velocity information of multiple {UAVs.}},

It consists of a thin layer of bi-elastic fabric placed on the top of a hollow cylinder and tied to an external circular crown which can run outside over the cylinder. The crown can be moved upward and downward by means of a {DC} motor. The crown is connected to the female screw by means of four supports which slide along suitable loops. When the motor pulls down the crown, the fabric is stretched and its apparent stiffness increases. Conversely, when the motor pushes up the crown the fabric is relaxed and it feels softer. Subjects can touch the fabric and feel different levels of softness according to the stretching induced by the motor. Being the fabric deformable in a controlled way under the fingerpad, this new device is able to provide cues for a more reliable and realistic perception. During this demo the device will be controlled to provide subjects with different artificial degrees of softness.},

In the typical scientific data, with many different properties such as pressure, temperature, strain, etc, the user is required to switch between what data to represent through the haptic feedback. In this paper we explore the possibility to simultaneously represent, in a comprehensive way, more than one property through the haptic feedback by dividing the feedback into the two components of the haptic sense. Two vibrotactile metaphors for scalar data are described, roughness and transition cue, that can be used in combination with a kinaesthetic representation of either scalar or vector data. The paper also presents an evaluation that shows that the individual cues from the two haptic metaphors can be discriminated, and that the combined feedback can be used to find combinations of features in data.},

In this context, the choice of suitable local cost or distance measures is of crucial importance, since they determine the kind of (spatial) similarity between the elements (frames) of the two sequences to be aligned. For the mocap domain, we introduce two conceptually different local distance measures – one based on joint angle parameters and the other based on {3D} coordinates – and discuss their respective strengths and weaknesses (Sect. 10.1). The importance of {DTW} is then illustrated by some synthesis and analysis applications (Sect. 10.2). By comparing a motion data stream to itself, one obtains a cost or distance matrix that exhibits self-similarities within the motion. In Sect. 10.3, we describe how this idea can be exploited for motion retrieval. Finally, in Sect. 10.4, we discuss some work related to {DTW-based} motion retrieval.},

The usage of packet-switched networks for bilateral telemanipulation systems is challenging due to several adversities such as low transmission rates, packet delays, jitter and losses. The previously proposed deadband-based haptic data reduction approaches selectively decrease the high transmission rate of the force-feedback and position/velocity samples on account of human perception limitations. Recently, an error-resilient perceptual haptic data reduction approach was proposed to address the packet losses in the feedback channel. However, the impact of faltered transmission on the forward channel and its subjective influence on the user are still an open issue and thus are treated in this paper.},

	abstract = {The objective of this work is to demonstrate that progressive haptic guidance can accelerate and improve motor task training outcomes over visual or practice-only methods in a training virtual environment ({TVE).} To that end, we design haptic and visual guidance schemes based on detailed analyses of performance differences between experts and novice trainees performing a dynamic motor control task in a {TVE.} Research shows that {TVEs} that include haptic interfaces produce significant short-term performance gains over audio visual {TVEs.} However, improved or accelerated long-term training outcomes for dynamic tasks have yet to be demonstrated due, at least in part, to the increasing dependence of the trainee on the assistance. To avoid this dependence, a progressive guidance controller can gradually remove the assistance as the performance of the trainee improves. However, the inputs to the guidance controller must be based on measurements of performance in the necessary kinematic and dynamic components of the task. Prior work introduced two such quantitative performance measures. We implement similar measures, trajectory error and input frequency, to identify and classify performance levels, thereby providing valid and robust inputs to the guidance controller. We demonstrate that progressive haptic guidance schemes can improve training in a dynamic task.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a new subminiature impact type actuator which creates the haptic sensation in a mobile device. Recently, linear resonance actuators ({LRA)} are widely used. One of the key differences between an {LRA} and a traditional eccentric motor is that the {LRA} generates the vibrotactile sensation through resonance for minimizing response time. The strategy of operation near the resonant frequency, however, brought a new issue for creating vibrotactile sensation which can be strong enough to feel in arbitrary frequency. In order to achieve this issue, we adopt an unstable structure to amplify impact force and to reduce response rate. Due to the impact with fast rising and falling time in the proposed impact actuator, the available strong impact vibration is created over wide frequency range from {0Hz} to {100Hz.} The impact vibration generated from the proposed actuator is suitable for reproducing realistic button sensation and creating various vibration patterns in mobile devices.},

Their applications span from music composition and sound organization to audio synthesis and processing, as the interest in feedback resulted both from theoretical reflection on cybernetics and system theory, and from practical experimentation on analog circuits. The advent of computers has made possible the implementation of complex theoretical systems in audio-domain oriented applications, in some sense bridging the gap between theory and practice in the analog domain, and further increasing the range of audio and musical applications of feedback systems.
In this article we first sketch a minimal history of feedback in music; second, we briefly introduce feedback systems from a theoretical point of view; then we propose a set of features that characterize them from the perspective of music applications; finally, we propose a typology targeted at feedback systems used in the audio/musical domain and discuss some relevant examples.},

The algorithm uses a \&amp;\#8220;haptic equalizer\&amp;\#8221; and provides plausible sound-to-touch modality conversion based on human perceptual data. In addition, we present a user study carried out to evaluate the subjective performance (precision, harmony, fun, and preference) of the haptic music player, in comparison with the current practice of bass-band only vibrotactile playback via a single-frequency voice-coil actuator. The evaluation results indicated that the new dual-band playback outperforms the bass-only rendering, also providing several insights for further improvements.

From various recent research, it seems reasonable to claim that most people, regardless of levels of musical expertise, have fairly good knowledge of the relationship between sound and sound production, as e.g. manifest in various cases of ’air instrument’ performance and other spontaneous body movements to musical sound. The challenge now is to explore these sound-action links further, in particular at the micro-levels of musical sound such as in timbre and texture, and at the meso-levels of various rhythmical and contoural features. As suggested by the seminal work of Pierre Schaeffer and co-workers on so-called sonic objects several decades ago, perceptually salient features can be found on the chunk-level in music, meaning in fragments of sound-action in the approximately 0.5 to 5 seconds range. In this chapter, research on the emergence of sound-action chunks and their features will be presented together with some ideas for practical applications.},

A methodology is presented integrating narrative analysis and iterative prototyping, based on gestural and performance data. Implementation of these theories should improve the efficiency and design of vocal augmentation in theatrical contexts; increasing generalizability, dramatic integration, and facilitating a more cohesive, contextualized performance. The present study demonstrates the potential application of the theories of mediality and embodied music cognition in the development of technological mediators, as well as possible dynamic mappings strategies based on gesture audio interaction and the physical realization of the performer's musical goals.},

The fingernail sensor uses photoplethysmography to measure the change in blood perfusion in the fingernail bed when the fingerpad touches a surface with various forces. The original fingernail sensor was rigidly attached to the human fingernail, necessitating a customized fabrication for each individual user. Using novel fabrication techniques, a new stretchable sensor has been developed, where optoelectronic components are embedded within a soft rubber substrate, connected by stretchable conductors. This stretchable sensor can conform to the two-dimensional curvature of any human finger, eliminating the need for individual customization. In this paper, we demonstrate the successful fabrication of a prototype sensor with two {LEDs} and two photodetectors.},

This framework, called space of possibilities ({SoP)}, is based on crossing the different constraints a player must face when playing his/her instrument. These constraints can be acoustical, biomechanical, and are considered along with the musicians' acquired skills. Such an approach can provide a unified ground for modelling performer–instrument relationships by encompassing different perspectives within a single view. We propose to define this {SoP} through the review of various computational techniques for expressive gestures: feature-based approaches, dynamic modelling, and segmental modelling. More precisely, we see how the notions of gesture invariance and variability, gesture qualities, and gesture primitives can help structure {SoP.}},

	abstract = {A series of experiments was conducted to evaluate how contact pressure and surface roughness influence the heat flux conducted out of the skin or object during contact. Changes in skin temperature assist in identifying objects held in the hand. In the first experiment an infrared thermal imaging system was used to measure skin temperature and contact area as participants generated forces ranging from 0.1 to 6 N with their index finger. The results showed that skin temperature decreased by an average of {5.5degC} across the range of forces studied and that the changes were greatest between 0.25-0.35 N and from 4-6 N. The second and third experiments examined the effect of the surface roughness of an object on skin temperature and on the perceived coldness of the object. A set of six copper blocks was machined to create a range of surface profiles. There was a slight decrease in skin temperature as the surface roughness of the object increased, contrary to theoretical predictions. Although small, these changes were perceptible as participants consistently chose the rougher of two stimuli when asked to select the cooler stimulus. These results indicate that contact pressure and surface roughness influence the change in skin temperature during contact and that they can have a perceptible influence on the perceived properties of objects held in the hand. Thermal models need to account for these effects if realistic feedback is to be presented in a thermal display.},

	abstract = {The alignments and crosslinks obtained from audio synchronization (Chap. 5) and audio matching (Chap. 6) can be used to conveniently switch between different versions of a piece of music (interdocument navigation). We will now address the problem of audio structure analysis, which lays the basis for intradocument navigation. One major goal of the structural analysis of an audio recording is to automatically extract the repetitive structure or, more generally, the musical form of the underlying piece of music. Recent approaches such as [14,37,46,49,81,127,129,139,161]work well for music where the repetitions largely agree with respect to instrumentation and tempo as it is typically the case for popular music. For other classes of music including Western classical music, however, musically similar audio segments may exhibit significant variations in parameters such as dynamics, timbre, execution of note groups, musical key, articulation, and tempo progression. In this chapter, we propose robust and efficient algorithms for structure analysis that identifies musically similar segments. To obtain a flexible and robust algorithm, the idea is to simultaneously account for possible variations at various stages and levels. At the feature level, we use coarse chroma-based audio features that absorb microvariations. To cope with local variations, we design an advanced cost measure by integrating contextual information (Sect. 7.2). Finally, we describe a new strategy for structure extraction that can cope with more global variations (Sects. 7.3 and 7.4). Our experimental results with classical and popular music show that our algorithm performs successfully even in the presence of significant musical variations (Sect. 7.5). In Sect. 7.1, we start by summarizing a general strategy for audio structure analysis and introduce some notation that is used throughout this chapter. Related work and future research directions will be discussed in Sect. 7.6. In this chapter, we closely follow [139]. The enhancement strategy of self-similarity matrices by introducing a contextual local cost measure has first been described in [137].},

	abstract = {Visual communication is an important aspect of musical performance. It is used, for example, to pick up temporal cues and find the right entries. Visual cues can also be instrumental to negotiating the solo order in improvised music or enabling social exchanges, such as signalizing to someone that her solo was well received. The problem with visual communication is that one has to catch someone else's attention. Visual cues outside someone's visual field cannot be detected, even more so if the addressee is busy reading a music score or closing his eyes in a Free Music session. While acoustic communication avoids these challenges, it tends to interfere with the music. The haptic modality has the advantage that it does not necessarily interfere with the acoustic signal, and does not require attention. However, it allows interpersonal communication if both parties are within close proximity. Using telematic interfaces the problem of proximity can be solved to allow participants to communicate over any physical distance. In this paper, our research focuses on polyphonic pitch model to transform audio signals into haptic cues for hearing impaired users.},

	abstract = {The objective of the present study was to provide a better understanding of the factors that influence discrimination and subjective assessment of vibrotactile feedbacks during active interaction with a touchscreen. Twenty-four participants were presented with 162 pairs of vibrotactile signals that varied in frequency (60 Hz, 130 Hz, 200 Hz), waveform (sine, square and triangle), and duration (around 123 ms for short and 163 ms for long). Participants had to complete three successive tasks: a dissimilarity task, a preference judgement task, and a resemblance (to push-buttons) judgement task. For the discrimination task, a {MultiDimensional} Scale analysis revealed: (1) a predominant role of frequency, (2) a role of duration for a given frequency, and (3) no role of waveform. An analysis of variance performed on the preference and resemblance data also point out the main role of the signal frequency. Finally, a correlation was found between preference and resemblance data, indicating that the participants tend to prefer signals judged to be similar to familiar tactile sensations.},

One of the consequences of the chronic late stage of the disease is atrophy of the dorsal columns of the spinal cord, leading to loss of the tracts carrying touch and proprioception. This in turn led to the characteristic broad based staggering gait and uncontrolled ataxic movements. Dispassionate accounts of the consequences of this may have been made more difficult by the fact that with ataxia comes intractable lightning pains1. That such deafferentiation could arise from other peripheral and central causes of loss of proprioception was less clear2},

These parameters are then used to control the granulation of arbitrary sound samples in real time.

	abstract = {Abstract Research into music generation and into emulating human musical competence has attracted much attention in the field of computer science. In general, the results of academic research should be verified by assessing ‘objective effectiveness’, which is often represented by a ‘recognition ratio’. Although ‘objective effectiveness’ is also a requirement for research in music generation, it is meaningless unless subjective requisites are also satisfied. However, it is not easy for researchers to execute subjective evaluations within their individual endeavours. To address this difficulty within the research area of computer systems for generating expressive music performances, the Performance Rendering Contest (Rencon) was created. This is an international competition in which entrants present computer systems and the performances generated are graded, and has been held in conjunction with related international conferences. This paper presents an overview of Rencon history, highlighting the evaluative motivation of each contest. In addition, we discuss the possibilities of a new scientific research field in which future Rencons may play a role.},

Employing an iterative warping and averaging strategy, we then describe an efficient algorithm that automatically derives a motion template from a class of training motions. We summarize the main ideas of this algorithm in Sect. 13.2 before giving the technical details in Sect. 13.3. In Sect. 13.4, we report on our experiments on template learning and discuss a number of illustrative examples to demonstrate the descriptive power of motion templates. Finally, in Sect. 13.5, we close with some general remarks on the multiple alignment problem underlying our learning procedure.

	abstract = {Today, in production engineering we have already taken into usage complex virtual representations of the manufacturing environment were we can program, simulate, analyse and optimise key performances. Such systems are mainly working through keyboard/ mouse input while user feedback normally are direct visual through computer screen and text files. Such communication only relays on a limited spectre of our senses and the keyboard/mouse/screen systems cannot be said to be very human friendly, especially when the operator is expected to operate ldquoout of officerdquo in a unstructured, maybe dangerous or dirty, environment. In the near future we expect to see more advanced input/output devices like motion capturing and speech input systems while feedback will not be visual alone but include several other human senses. Combinatorial sensory information, interpreted by the human brain, becomes very handy when a stand alone sense is not enough to interpret the actual situation. Imitation of senses and feedback from virtual reality environments always meant a great problem. Realization of two (sight and hearing) out of the five human senses is indispensable. Simulation of these two senses is not complex issue; on the contrary the other three are quite challenging. This paper describes the development of a vibro-tactile glove which can provide sensory feedback from a virtual environment, either as a stand alone system but most important in combination with sight and audio feedback systems. Instead of implementing real force feedback, the focus is on tactile sensing, as an alternative way of achieving the same feedback. The glove contains six vibration motors on different locations on the hand. These locations include all five fingers, and the palm. Communication with the glove is wireless, enabling free movement for the user. The system is low cost and very small sized which allows for combining it with advanced input devices like a motion capturing suit.},

	abstract = {Dynamic time warping ({DTW)} is a well-known technique to find an optimal alignment between two given (time-dependent) sequences under certain restrictions (Fig. 4.1). Intuitively, the sequences are warped in a nonlinear fashion to match each other. Originally, {DTW} has been used to compare different speech patterns in automatic speech recognition, see [170]. In fields such as data mining and information retrieval, {DTW} has been successfully applied to automatically cope with time deformations and different speeds associated with time-dependent data. In this chapter, we introduce and discuss the main ideas of classical {DTW} (Sect. 4.1) and summarize several modifications concerning local as well as global parameters (Sect. 4.2). To speed up classical {DTW}, we describe in Sect. 4.3 a general multiscale {DTW} approach. In Sect. 4.4, we show how {DTW} can be employed to identify all subsequence within a long data stream that are similar to a given query sequence (Sect. 4.4). A discussion of related alignment techniques and references to the literature can be found in Sect. 4.5.},

Using a model ({3D} finite element representation of fingertip skin, linear bi-phasic transduction function, and leaky-integrate-and-fire neuronal model), we systematically varied populations of tactile receptors in dimensions of density (100, 45, 20, and 10 sensors/cm2) and size (diameter 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, and 1.0 mm) to determine if a given modeled population can discriminate spheres and cylinders representative of objects used in activities of daily living. Using a scoring system which allows for direct comparisons between the populations, our results indicate that a population must have at least 20 sensors per cm2 to maintain response resolution in these activities of daily living and that larger-sized sensors do not degrade response resolution.},

	abstract = {{AbstractTelematic} musical performance, in which performers at two or more sites collaborate via networked audio and video, suffers significantly from latency. In the extreme case, performers at all sites slow to match their delayed counterparts, resulting in a steadily decreasing tempo. Introducing video of a conductor does not immediately solve the problem, as conductor video is also subjected to network latencies. This article lays the groundwork for an alternative approach to mitigating the effects of latency in distributed orchestral performances, based on generation of a predicted version of the conductor's baton trajectory. The prediction step is the most fundamental problem in this scheme, for which we propose the use of conventional machine learning techniques. Specifically, we demonstrate a particle filter and an extended Kalman filter that each track the location of the baton's tip and predict it multiple beats into the future; we compare these with a conventional feature-based method. We also describe a generic two-part framework that prescribes the incorporation of rehearsal data into a probabilistic model, which is then adapted during live performance. Finally, we suggest a framework and experimental methodology for establishing perceptually based metrics for predicted baton paths. Note that the perceptual efficacy of the presented methods requires experimental confirmation beyond the scope of this article.},

Furthermore, they do not scale: studies show that users with large mp3 collections have abandoned the concept of playlists. To remedy the usability problems associated with playlist creation and navigation - in particular, reliance on visual feedback and the absence of rapid content scanning mechanisms - we propose a system that utilizes the haptic channel. A necessary first step in this objective is the creation of a haptic mapping for music. In this paper, we describe an exploratory study addressed at understanding the feasibility, with respect to learnability and usability, of efficient, eyes-free playlist navigation based on symbolic haptic renderings of key song parameters. Users were able to learn haptic mappings for music parameters to usable accuracy with 4 minutes of training. These results indicate promise for the approach and support for continued effort in both improving the rendering scheme and implementing the haptic playlist system.},

The hypothesis that timing accuracy is related to sensory (tactile) information available at finger-key contact was extended to clarinetists' finger movements during key depressions and releases that, together with breathing, determine the timing of tone onsets. Skilled clarinetists performed melodies at different tempi in a synchronization task while their movements were recorded with motion capture. Finger accelerations indicated consistent kinematic landmarks when fingers made initial contact with or release from the key surface. Performances that contained more kinematic landmarks had reduced timing error. The magnitude of finger accelerations on key contact and release was positively correlated with increased temporal accuracy during the subsequent keystroke. These findings suggest that sensory information available at finger-key contact enhances the temporal accuracy of music performance.},

	abstract = {In cognitive science and philosophy, the conception of cognition has evolved rapidly in recent years. It is no longer strictly a process that happens inside the head, intervening between perception and action. Instead, cognition is considered something that subsumes both perception and action, engages the body, and even incorporates the response of objects in the environment to actions taken upon them. One speaks of cognition being embodied and extended. Cognitive processes such as problem solving might actually involve the coupled dynamics of the body and the environment, where the finding of problem solutions involves interactively driving the coupled dynamics toward behaviors that satisfy the task goals of an individual. Researchers in haptics have long been working with the notions of dynamical coupling between the body and environment, with interwoven definitions of perception and action, and with flexible conceptions of the proximal and distal and the physical and virtual. It is perhaps striking to suppose that the activity during which our users wield our interface devices might be considered cognition itself. We suggest in this paper that the field of haptics is uniquely positioned to draw upon and to contribute to active debates in cognitive science, and that a new interpretation of “interface” can be useful in launching such an endeavor.},

	abstract = {In everyday life the human brain is confronted with an enormous amount of sensory input at any given moment. To guarantee coherent and adaptive behaviour, selective attention is needed to focus the limited processing resources on the relevant part of the available information while ignoring the rest [1, 2]. This chapter provides an overview on some topics of current research in attention and the sense of touch. We will mainly focus on studies using mechanical stimuli rather than electrical stimulation. The physical characteristics of electrical stimuli (sharp and short duration of only a fraction of a millisecond) makes them closer to pain stimuli and, thus, suboptimal to mimic the complex interactions between different mechanoreceptors of the glabrous skin [3–5]. In contrast, mechanical stimuli have not such a sharp onset (mostly they are delivered in form of a sinusoid, see below) and make contact with the skin for much longer.},

The system of sensory physiology (of which touch is one important element) is shaped by the influence of both medical thought and the philosophy of nature. Let us turn first to ancient Indian medicine or natural philosophy, as it appears in the Vedas. The Vedas are the most ancient Indian religious texts and consist for the most part of hymns, liturgical chants, sacrificial formulas and magic spells. The Rgveda, the oldest of the vedic texts, has not yet a verb for ‘touch’ or ‘feel’ and no expression for the corresponding sensation which — in a later text entitled Atharvaveda — is called sam-sparsa (feeling) [1]. In the Ayurveda, which forms an appendix to the Atharvaveda, the primeval matter (sattva) acts upon the fives senses of knowledge or buddhīndrīya (hearing, touch, sight, taste, smell — Fig. 1).},

	abstract = {Aposematic insects use warning colours to deter predators, but many also produce odours or sounds when attacked by a predator. One possible role for these additional components is that they promote the association between the warning colour and the non-profitability it signals, thus reducing the chance of future attacks from visually hunting predators. This experiment explicitly tests this idea by looking at the effects of sound on a visual discrimination task. Young domestic chicks were trained to look for food rewards under coloured paper cones scattered in an experimental arena. In a subsequent visual discrimination task, they learned to discriminate between rewarded and non-rewarded hats on the basis of colour. Half the chicks performed this task in silence, whilst the other half had a tone played when they attacked non-rewarded hats. The presence of the tone improved the speed of colour discrimination learning. This demonstrates that there could be a selective advantage for aposematic coloured insects to emit sounds when attacked, since avian predators will learn to avoid their coloration more quickly. The role of psychological interactions between signal components in receivers is discussed in relation to the evolution of multimodal displays.},

Of particular interest is the match between the musician's mental focus on musical targets (the so-called musical intentions) and the expressive (or so-called auxiliary) body movements. To what extent are these related to each other? And what does this relationship reveal about mind–body connections? To approach these questions, a case study was set up around a clarinet solo performance played from score, covering a style of music unfamiliar to the player. The clarinetist's movements were recorded with an optical movement tracking system. A statistical analysis method was developed, to account for movement data in relation to the potential musical intentions and targets. The bottom-up movement analysis method was validated with the performer's annotations of targets in the musical score and the performer's annotations of communicative/sound facilitating gestures in the performance video. The results reveal that the mental focus on musical targets is related to bodily expression. This finding supports the idea of an embodied model of musical syntax processing, which is strongly related to corporeal gestures.},

In this paper we present strategies for structuring the development process, based on iterative design and participatory design. The concepts are described in theory and examples are given of how they have been successfully applied. The cases make heavy use of different types of prototyping and this practice is also discussed. The development cases all relate to a single artifact, a gestural voice processing instrument called The Throat. This artifact has been in use since it was developed, and from that experience, three cases are presented. The focus of these cases is on how artistic vision through practice can recontextualize technology, and, without rebuilding it, redefine it and give it a new role to play.},

The results show that the vibration levels are well above threshold for almost all positions on the instruments in normal playing. It is concluded that the perceived vibrations may be of some assistance with regard to intonation in ensemble playing, in particular for the bass instruments. The finger forces exerted when playing the bowed strings, as well as the touch forces in piano playing were studied briefly. It was concluded that the kinesthetic forces perceived in playing may assist the timing in performance.},

The principal part is the realization of a high-quality haptic interaction of the car door for the manual operation. We implemented and tested four different impedance control schemes, of which impedance control with actuator force feedback performed best. This control scheme was subsequently used to haptically render different supportive dynamics and effects. An experimental evaluation with 16 participants revealed a predominant approval of the haptic sensation of the actuated car door.},

As the main conceptual contribution, we introduce a simple yet powerful paradigm that exploits the availability of different versions (recorded performances, score) of the same piece of music to stabilize and enrich the chord labelling process. As a result, we obtain a version-independent representation of the chord labelling results on a musically meaningful time axis given in bars. Furthermore, a visualization of this representation reveals consistencies and inconsistencies in the labelling results across different versions. Using this visualization for performing a detailed harmonic analysis of the Appassionata, it turns out that the consistencies typically correspond to harmonically stable passages and thus are of musical relevance. This shows that our visualization can be used as a supportive tool for exploring harmonic structures and constitutes a source of inspiration for musicologists.},

We investigate the illumination distribution and its changes under some simple deformation of the sensor surface with a ray-trace simulation.

Behavioral results showed that participants discriminate the two levels of roughness at the three velocities explored in the study but they were judged as equivalent in pleasantness. The {ERP} results showed a biphasic early-fast N1-P2 deflection. The N1 and P2 peaks to the smoother texture occur earlier than that of the rougher texture. Considering velocity, the N1 onset occurs later for the slowest velocity, followed by the intermediate velocity and earlier for the fastest velocity and the three velocities differ significantly. {LORETA} analysis showed that N1 and P2 components of surface roughness are both related to the activation produced in the somatosensory cortex and posterior cingulated respectively, suggesting that these areas might be involved in the sensory processing of roughness.},

Most simulations only engage two of our five senses: sight and hearing. If we employ additional sensory communication channels in simulations, we may gain a deeper understanding of illustrated concepts by increasing the communication bandwidth and providing alternative perspectives. We implemented the sense of touch in {3D} simulations to teach important concepts in introductory physics. Specifically, we developed a visuo-haptic simulation for friction. We prove that interactive {3D} haptic simulations – if carefully developed and deployed – are useful in engaging students and allowing them to understand concepts faster. We hypothesize that large scale deployment of such haptic-based simulators in science laboratories is now possible due to the advancements in haptic software and hardware technology.},

To date, studies investigating thermal feedback for affective interaction have either provided concepts and prototypes, or looked at the affective element of thermal stimuli in isolation. This research is the first to look in-depth at how thermal stimuli can be used to influence the perception of different media. We conducted two studies which looked at the effect of thermal stimuli on subjective emotional responses to media. In the first we presented visual information designed to evoke emotional responses in conjunction with different thermal stimuli. In the second we used different methods to present thermal stimuli in conjunction with music. Our results highlight the possibility of using thermal stimuli to create more affective interactions in a variety of media interaction scenarios.},

In particular, bulky gloves inhibit the ability to interact with standard computing interfaces such as a mouse or keyboard. This paper presents the results of a preliminary investigation into a system that permits the space suit gloves themselves to be used as data entry devices. Hand motion tracking is combined with simple finger gesture recognition to enable use of a virtual keyboard, while tactile feedback provides touch-based context to the graphical user interface ({GUI)} and positive confirmation of keystroke events. In human subject trials, conducted with twenty participants using a prototype system, participants entered text significantly faster with tactile feedback than without (p = 0.02). The results support incorporation of vibrotactile information in a future system that will enable full touch typing and general mouse interactions using instrumented {EVA} gloves.},

Students from an elementary school at the fourth and sixth grades were recruited to participate in the study. The students were separated into visual and visuohaptic groups to measure the possible benefits haptic feedback might provide as compared to the vision-alone condition. A 10-question content test was developed and administered before and after the learning activities. The pretest and posttest scores showed that all students benefited from the computer simulations. The visuohaptic group did not perform significantly better than the visual group. An important finding was that the fourth graders learned as much as the sixth graders, despite their younger age and little prior exposure to concepts such as density and volume, which are important for understanding buoyancy. Future work will design instructional and assessment materials that focus more on the haptic modality.},

To guarantee coherent and adaptive behaviour, selective attention is needed to focus the limited processing resources on the relevant part of the available information while ignoring the rest [1, 2]. This chapter provides an overview on some topics of current research in attention and the sense of touch. We will mainly focus on studies using mechanical stimuli rather than electrical stimulation. The physical characteristics of electrical stimuli (sharp and short duration of only a fraction of a millisecond) makes them closer to pain stimuli and, thus, suboptimal to mimic the complex interactions between different mechanoreceptors of the glabrous skin [3–5]. In contrast, mechanical stimuli have not such a sharp onset (mostly they are delivered in form of a sinusoid, see below) and make contact with the skin for much longer.},

	abstract = {Molecular interactions typically have a high dynamic range ({HDR)}, combining short-range stiff repulsive effects with long-range, soft attractive and repulsive terms. As a result, faithful haptic rendering of such molecular interactions is both important and difficult, in particular in applications where the precise perception of molecular forces is necessary (e.g. in molecular docking simulations). Traditionally, teleoperation coupling using constant gain control schemes have limited applications since they are unable to transmit to users low attractive forces without truncating repulsive ones. Furthermore, constant scaling displacement induces either instability or time-consuming experiments (displacements are slow), which deteriorates the ease of manipulation. In this paper, we describe a variable gain haptic coupling method specifically designed to render high dynamic range (molecular) forces. The proposed method is evaluated by user tests on an experiment involving two water molecules. We observe that variable force amplification is widely appreciated, whereas variable displacement scaling is appropriated only for users familiar with haptic manipulation. A complex experiment on a {HIV} molecule is carried out using this variable gain system. Advantages and limitations of this approach are discussed.},

Here, the possibilities range from isolated pose-based queries up to query-by-example ({QBE)}, where the user supplies the system with a short query motion clip. In Sect. 12.2, we present a flexible and efficient {QBE-based} motion retrieval system and report on experimental results. Furthermore, we show how our relational approach to motion comparison can be used as a general tool for efficient motion preprocessing (Sect. 12.3).

In this paper we introduce a novel method for satisfying high force update rates with deformable objects, yet retaining the visual quality of complex deformations and interactions. The objects that are haptically manipulated may have many degrees of freedom, but haptic interaction is often implemented in practice through low-dimensional force-feedback devices. We exploit the low-dimensional domain of the interaction for devising a novel linear approximation of interaction forces that can be efficiently evaluated at force-update rates. Moreover, our linearized force model is time-implicit, which implies that it accounts for contact constraints and the internal dynamics of deforming objects. In this paper we show examples of haptic interaction in complex situations such as large deformations, collision between deformable objects (with friction), or even self-collision.},

The first experiment compared the effects of four different haptic augmentations on usability in a simple targeting task. The second experiment involved a more ecologically-oriented searching and scrolling task. Results indicated that the haptic effects did not improve users performance in terms of task completion time. However, the number of errors made was significantly reduced. Subjective workload measures showed that participants perceived many aspects of workload as significantly less with haptics.

	abstract = {The documentation of electroacoustic and mixed musical works typically relies on a posteriori data collection. In this article, we argue that the preservation of musical works having technological components should be grounded in a thorough documentation of the creative process that accounts for both human and nonhuman agents of creation. The present research aims at providing a ground for documentation policies that account for the creative process and provide relevant information for performance, migration, and analysis. To do so, we analyzed secondary ethnographic data from a two-year creation and production process of a musical work having a focus on gesture following. Using grounded theory, we developed a conceptual framework with different levels of abstraction and consequent levels of transferability to other creative contexts. Finally, we propose several paths for grounding a subsequent documentation framework in this conceptual framework.},

	abstract = {The paper presents a method for sonification of human body motion based on motiongrams. Motiongrams show the spatiotemporal development of body motion by plotting average matrices of motion images over time. The resultant visual representation resembles spectrograms, and is treated as such by the new sonifyer module for Jamoma for Max, which turns motiongrams into sound by reading a part of the matrix and passing it on to an oscillator bank. The method is surprisingly simple, and has proven to be useful for analytical applications and in interactive music systems.

The 5th century {B.C.E.} historian Herodotus described the actions of a probably psychotic Spartan leader, Cleomenes, who mutilated him by slicing his flesh into strips with a knife; starting with his shins he worked upwards to his thighs, hips, and sides until he reached his abdomen which he chopped into mincemeat. The Gospel of Mark 5∶5 describes a repetitive self-injurer, a man who “night and day would cry aloud among the tombs and on the hillsides and cut himself with stones.”},

The goal of this paper is to set out requirements and guidelines for the Performance measures of haptic devices and to hopefully lead towards resolving the current equivocal Situation. In particular, Performance measures are introduced which have so far not been pertinent in traditional robotics; these include, peak force, peak acceleration and frequency dependent measurements. Performance measures often quoted in traditional robotics are also discussed, however, the focus and relevance of these measures are different in haptic devices. Each of the suggested Performance measures in this paper is discussed with respect to its importance, its measurabilty and the condition under which it should be measured.},

	abstract = {Automatic music processing poses a number of challenging questions because of the complexity and diversity of music data. As discussed in Sect. 2.1, one generally has to account for various aspects such as the data format (e.g., score, {MIDI}, audio), the instrumentation (e.g., orchestra, piano, drums, voice), and many other parameters such as articulation, dynamics, or tempo. To make music data comparable and algorithmically accessible, the first step in all music processing tasks is to extract suitable features that capture relevant key aspects while suppressing irrelevant details or variations. Here, the notion of similarity is of crucial importance in the design of audio features. In some applications and particularly in the case in music retrieval, one may be interested in characterizing an audio recording irrespective of certain details concerning the interpretation or instrumentation. Conversely, other applications may be concerned with measuring just the niceties that relate to a musician’s individual articulation or emotional expressiveness.},

	abstract = {The active control of exploratory movements is an integral part of active touch. We investigated how the spatio-temporal extension of an exploration affects texture discrimination via active touch and how participants spontaneously control the extension of their exploration. Participants stroke one to 8 times across a virtual grating. Half of the participants judged the grating according to ridge amplitude, the other half judged ridge period. In both tasks just noticeable differences ({JNDs)} decreased with an increasing number of strokes, down to a (presumably) minimum {JND} for stroke numbers of about 6-7 or higher (according to a model fit). This extends previous findings on the perceptual effects of extended stimulation to the domain of active touch. Further, for spontaneous exploration, 6-7 strokes may be regarded as being optimal, given that this extension results in minimal {JNDs} while using the smallest number of strokes necessary. Many participants tended to spontaneously use clearly more than this optimal number of strokes, before they had experience with the task. With experience, stroke numbers were, however, individually closer to and, on average slightly below this number. That is, participants seem to have adapted their exploration to the task. This supports the view that the active control of exploratory movements can be used in order to optimize performance-when participants have sufficient experience with the haptic task.},

Previous attempts to use algorithmic tools in this field focused typically on tempo and dynamics alone. We base our analysis on ten different performance categories (such as bowing, vibrato and durations). We adapt phylogenetic analysis tools to resolve the inherent inconsistencies between these categories, and describe the relationships between performances. Taking samples from 29 different performances of two pieces from Bach's sonatas for solo violin, we construct a ‘phylogenetic’ tree, representing the relationship between those performances. The tree supports several interesting relations previously conjectured by the musicology community, such as the importance of date of birth and recording period in determining interpretative style. Our work also highlights some unexpected inter-connections between performers, and challenges previous assumptions regarding the significance of educational background and affiliation to the historically informed performance ({HIP)} style.},

	abstract = {A great variety of interactions between senses, and between motor production and senses, have been reported in previous research. In the present study, we tested whether the mechanics of a plucked string affected how the sound it produced was perceived. To test this hypothesis, we simulated the feel of a plucked string using a high fidelity haptic force-feedback device and simultaneously simulated its acoustic emission. This way, we could independently manipulate the two sensory inputs — how it felt and how it sounded — together with physical correct haptic interaction and with accurate synchronization. This arrangement makes it very plausible that the two sensory inputs came from a common source. We used a two-interval forced-choice discrimination procedure to determine the point of subjective equality of the loudness between a stiff and a soft plucked string. When the stiffness of the string was low, the sound was perceived to be softer. Interestingly, this effect was found only when the first string was less stiff than the second string plucked during a comparison. The results are consistent with the inverse effectiveness principle of multisensory integration.},

We had experiments and showed participants perceived angles of edges that was the same as the one they were visually touching, even though the angles of edges they were actually touching was different. These results prove that the perceived angles of edges could be modified if the difference of angles between edges is in the range of − 35° to 30°.},

A stochastic analysis is presented to show stability improvement of a teleoperation system in the case when convergence of a Bayesian predictor is achieved and a generalized form of scattering transformation is used as a control scheme. Experiments are performed using a teleoperation system based on virtual reality. A haptic device is used as a human operator in conjunction with a mechanic-based virtual teleoperator by implementing the proposed Bayesian prediction method. Experimental results show that the proposed method improve stability of an overall teleoperation system in the presence of time-varying delay.},

The specific purpose of this approach is to evaluate the predictive power of different feature extraction sets based on human perception of music similarity and to develop an algorithm able to reproduce and predict human ratings. The algorithm is a linear model that was trained and tested using perceptual data. We use publicly available algorithms to extract acoustic feature values from 78 songs used in a previous perceptual experiment. Feature value differences between songs are used in a multivariate linear regression calculation to find the optimal weighting coefficients for the feature values to best approximate the human similarity perception data. We use two evaluation methods: metrical and ordinal. We use a bootstrapping approach by randomly separating the experimental data into training and testing sets. We compare the performance of this model against the {G1C} model by Pampalk, winner of the {MIREX} 2006 competition on music similarity prediction. Both models produce a rather low performance on the metrical evaluation. However, on the ordinal evaluation, the linear regression model shows encouraging results (significantly outperforming the {G1C} algorithm): in the triadic comparison task, it can correctly predict 52.3 ± 0.5\% of the most similar pairs, while the estimated theoretical maximum, based on participant consistency on the most similar pair rankings is 78 ± 8\%. In a comparison of feature sets, we found the {MIR} toolbox to produce the best performance.},

We first study the specifics of flamenco singing and propose a transcription system based on fundamental frequency and energy estimation, which incorporates an iterative strategy for note segmentation and labeling. The proposed approach is evaluated on a music collection of 72 performances, including a variety of singers and recording conditions, and the presence or absence of percussion, background voices, and noise. We obtain satisfying results for the different approaches tested, and our system outperforms a state-of-the-art approach designed for other singing styles. In this study, we discuss the difficulties found in transcribing flamenco singing and in evaluating the obtained transcriptions, we analyze the influence of the different steps of the algorithm, and we state the main limitations of our approach and discuss challenges for future studies.},

This position actually houses a number of distinct claims, some of which are more controversial than others. This paper distinguishes and evaluates the following six claims: (1) cognition is situated; (2) cognition is time-pressured; (3) we off-load cognitive work onto the environment; (4) the environment is part of the cognitive system; (5) cognition is for action; (6) offline cognition is body based. Of these, the first three and the fifth appear to be at least partially true, and their usefulness is best evaluated in terms of the range of their applicability. The fourth claim, I argue, is deeply problematic. The sixth claim has received the least attention in the literature on embodied cognition, but it may in fact be the best documented and most powerful of the six claims.},

	abstract = {In this work, a probabilistic model for multiple-instrument automatic music transcription is proposed. The model extends the shift-invariant probabilistic latent component analysis method, which is used for spectrogram factorization. Proposed extensions support the use of multiple spectral templates per pitch and per instrument source, as well as a time-varying pitch contribution for each source. Thus, this method can effectively be used for multiple-instrument automatic transcription. In addition, the shift-invariant aspect of the method can be exploited for detecting tuning changes and frequency modulations, as well as for visualizing pitch content. For note tracking and smoothing, pitch-wise hidden Markov models are used. For training, pitch templates from eight orchestral instruments were extracted, covering their complete note range. The transcription system was tested on multiple-instrument polyphonic recordings from the {RWC} database, a Disklavier data set, and the {MIREX} 2007 multi-F0 data set. Results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms leading approaches from the transcription literature, using several error metrics.},

Digital music technologies, on the other hand, are not limited to such natural couplings, but allow for arbitrary new relationships to be created between objects, actions and sounds. The endless possibilities of such virtual action–sound relationships can be exciting and creatively inspiring, but they can also lead to frustration among performers and confusion for audiences. This paper presents the theoretical foundations for an action–sound approach to electronic instrument design and discusses the ways in which this approach has shaped the undergraduate course titled {‘Interactive} Music’ at the University of Oslo. In this course, students start out by exploring various types of acoustic action–sound couplings before moving on to designing, building, performing and evaluating both analogue and digital electronic instruments from an action–sound perspective.},

This paper presents a set of experiments aimed at both determining the basic feasibility of using this kind of bracelet and to examine to what extent the orientation of the user’s wrist affects their perception of directional cues both in static and mobile conditions.

Haptic exploration is highly dependent on the number of fingers used for exploration of common objects [5], the largest difference appearing between the ‘one finger’ and the ‘two fingers’ conditions [6], and as proven by Jansson et al. [7] by the ability to discriminate a precise tactile pattern during the exploration.
